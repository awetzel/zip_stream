<p><font SIZE="+2">In any conflict situation, there are likely to be hundreds if not
thousands of parties who are constantly talking with one another about the conflict.
Often, the information which is being spread through these informal interactions contains
serious inaccuracies which are likely to make the conflict more destructive than
necessary. Such communications, which we call rumors, can also be spread through the mass
media--television, radio, newspapers, and the Internet.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">The key to effective rumor control efforts is an ability to perform
three functions. First, some mechanism is needed for determining what rumors are actually
circulating.&nbsp; Second, an effective strategy is needed for determining which rumors
are true, and which are false. Finally, mechanisms are needed for correcting inaccurate
rumors and replacing them with reliable information. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">The first step, rumor identification, requires the support of people in
each constituency group who are in a position to hear the latest rumors as they are
circulating. In general, these are people who are very active in the conflict and
interested in developing more constructive approaches. It is often helpful to provide
these &quot;rumor reporters&quot; with training so that they understand how misinformation
can drive the cycle destructive escalation. It is also important that these individuals to
be widely trusted by members of their constituency group.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">The next phase of the rumor control process requires a workable
mechanism determining the truthfulness of rumors. Here it is very helpful if the
&quot;rumor reporters&quot; can also serve as &quot;rumor investigators&quot; and help
determine, from their group's perspective, the accuracy of rumors pertaining to their
group. While there will certainly be cases were the practices of <a
href="../problem/secrecy.htm">secrecy and deception</a> make&nbsp; reliable rumor checking
impossible, there will also be many cases in which incorrect rumors can be at least
partially corrected. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">This rumor investigation mechanism can be structured in a variety of
ways--as long as it provides information which is widely regarded as trustworthy and
reliable. &quot;Rumor reporters&quot; might be organized into a committee which meets
periodically to exchange information about current rumors and then organize efforts to
determine their accuracy. These committees should also involve people with access to the
information needed to conduct effective investigations. Here the many the techniques
associated with <a href="factfinding.htm">fact-finding efforts</a> are likely to be
helpful.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Another way of structuring such a program involves widely trusted
neutral intermediaries who systematically contact key parties involved in a conflict to
identify and investigate the latest rumors. When these intermediaries hear a story which
they think is likely to be untrue, they initiate an investigation to try to determine
whether or not the story is accurate. Also needed is a plan for handling inconclusive
investigations. This means of the investigators have to clearly acknowledge cases in which
they are unable to determine the reliability of rumor. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">The third and final phase of rumor control efforts is rumor correction.
Here the investigators need some reliable mechanism for promptly reporting their findings
to interested parties. In cases were there is no agreement on what has happened, they
should report what is known, what is not known, and what is still being investigated. They
should also report differing interpretations of available facts.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">When an investigation determines that the rumor is not true, then a
plan for correcting the error&nbsp; must be initiated. The success of this plan depends
upon the credibility of the intermediaries and their ability to communicate widely,
effectively, and quickly. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Perhaps the best developed example of rumor control mechanisms is the <a
href="crisis_m.htm">crisis control centers</a> developed during the heart of the Cold War
to prevent incomplete information about the actions of opposing military forces from
escalating into a violent and dangerous confrontation between the United States and the
Soviet Union. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">At the local level, the United States Community Relations Service (an
arm of the U.S. Department of Justice) empowered to intervene in racial conflicts) has
utilized rumor control teams within communities in an effort to stop rumors that harm
intergroup relations.</font></p>
