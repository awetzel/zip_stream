<p><font size="3">Mirrors are devices that allow people to see themselves the way others
see them. Mirror imaging is a technique designed to help people see how their approach to
conflict looks to others. Mirror imaging does not require that the parties follow a lot of
complicated procedures and tricks. It simply requires that they to put aside their
prejudices and stereotypes and, at least temporarily, look at the world from the
perspective of others. This techniques helps people understand why proposals that may seem
perfectly reasonable to them are viewed as unacceptably selfish by others. It also helps
people understand why strategies that a party thinks are reasonable and moderate are
viewed as provocative and inflammatory by others. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Mirror building requires the parties to temporarily suspend judgement,
and to view others, especially their opponents, in a sympathetic light. Once judgement is
suspended, the parties can either engage in direct dialogues or related processes which
allow them to talk to one another. They can also read written documents describing
different views of the conflict or they can simply, honestly, think about how they would
feel if the situation was reversed. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Not only can this lead to constructive reframing of the conflict, this
approach can help the parties more reasonably assess the potential effectiveness of
alternative force, exchange, and integrative strategies as well as the risk of the
backlash effect. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">This type of introspection often teaches people things about themselves
that they wish were not true. In that sense it is an indispensable part of efforts to
build a more constructive future. </font></p>
