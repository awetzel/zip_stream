<p>Persuasion is the process of convincing an opponent to change his or her beliefs and/or
behavior through moral or logical argument (rather than force). When someone is persuaded
to do something, they do it because they have come to believe it is the right thing or the
best thing to do. They thus do it willingly, even gladly, not grudgingly, as they do when
they are forced to do something against their will. </p>

<p>Further, this behavior change is likely to be much more stable than change brought
about by force. When people are forced to do something they don't want to do, they usually
watch for their next opportunity to retaliate against their opponent, or reverse the
unwanted decision. If people are persuaded to change their behavior through moral or
logical argument, however, the person or group who has been so persuaded will agree with
the opponent's views--hence there is no need to retaliate or reverse the decision at a
later time.</p>

<p>In order for persuasion to be successful, it must be based on commonly held-beliefs
and/or values. If a disputant bases his or her arguments on selfish or one-sided
principles, these principles will almost certainly be rejected (and persuasion will fail).
If they base their argument on widely-held principles of fairness that all sides can agree
to, the persuasive effort is much more likely to succeed. </p>

<p>While different cultures and religions have widely differing views about morality,
fairness, and justice, there are often important areas of common ground that can serve as
a basis for powerful persuasive efforts. The United States, for example, has a
long-standing belief in the concept of equality before the law. Martin Luther King was
able to make great strides toward increasing the rights of African-Americans by arguing
that denying African-American equal rights was a violation of that principle. This appeal
was able to deliver white support of the African-American civil rights movement that a
simple revolt against the evils of which society could not have accomplished.</p>

<p>Even when common ground cannot be found, a debate about the relative merits of
competing value systems is far preferable and more constructive than the
&quot;might-makes-right&quot; pursuit of purely selfish motives. It is, therefore,
important that we identify common values which enjoy widespread support across political
and religions boundaries, as well as strategies for moving intractable conflicts toward
constructive moral debate. It is such a debate that will lead, over time and perhaps over
generations, to evolutionary changes in a society's fundamental values. </p>

    which have used moral arguments and an appeal to the population's sense of humanity to
    prevent further human rights violations.</dd>

    bring about settlements of international and communal conflicts. Among their tools, the
    authors explain, is effective persuasion.</dd>

  <dd>This article just mentions persuasion in passing, but it is interesting to note that the
    use of the Cuban blockade was done, in part, to give Kennedy the opportunity to use
    persuasion in addition to force in the Cuban Missile Crisis.</dd>

  <dd>Another form of persuasion is coercive persuasion based on the use of irrevocable
    commitments. Pruitt and Rubin illustrate this approach with a story about Gandhi's
    persuasive strategies, which while coercive, were also based on the common values of
    humanity and fairness.</dd>
