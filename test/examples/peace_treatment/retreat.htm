<p>Strategic retreat represents a partial solution to the bitter-end problem. When
confronted with a losing situation, the losing party accepts defeat in a way which allows
them to preserve as much of their resources, (both moral and physical) as possible. They
then set about the task of building their power base so that they can raise the issue more
successfully in the future. This may involve the development of efforts to expand their
coalition of supporters, define the moral justifications underlying their goals, build
enthusiasm among their current supporters, and strengthen their resource base. </p>

<p>Classically, this term refers to military retreats and the regrouping of forces. Since
military confrontations are commonly thought of as consisting of a series of battles, it
is generally considered to be good planning to retreat before one is completely defeated.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept applies equally well, however, to political and economic
struggles as well as nonviolent direct action. But in these cases people tend not to think
in terms of short term battles within long term struggles, so they may be more reluctant
to accept one defeat in an effort to win more in the future.&nbsp; </p>
