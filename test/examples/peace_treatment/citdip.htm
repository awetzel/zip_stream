<p>In situations in which official, diplomatic communications between countries or between
a government and an insurgent group have broken down, unofficial channels can often
operate effectively. The terms &quot;track two&quot; or &quot;citizen&quot; diplomacy
refer to unofficial contacts between people&#150;usually ordinary citizens&#150; which can
later pave the way for official &quot;first track&quot; or &quot;track one&quot;
diplomacy. </p>

<p>As originally conceived by Joe Montville, the term &quot;track two diplomacy&quot;
refers to private citizens negotiating topics that are usually reserved for official
negotiations&#150;the formal resolution of an ongoing conflict or arms reductions, for
example. Over time, however, the term has come to be used more broadly: to encompass
processes such as problem-solving workshops, dialogues, cultural and scientific exchanges,
traveling artists, sports teams, or any other contacts between people whose groups are
currently engaged in an intractable conflict. John McDonald and Louise Diamond invented
the term &quot;multi-track diplomacy&quot; to convey the sense that there are many ways to
bring people together in addition to official negotiations. They list nine tracks: 1)
official (track one) diplomacy; 2) unofficial, yet professional conflict resolution
processes, 3) international business negotiations and exchanges, 4) citizen exchanges
(such as teacher exchanges), 5) international research, education, and training efforts,
6) activism, 7) contacts and exchanges between religious leaders and followers, 8)
international funding efforts, and 9) public opinions and communication programs.</p>

<p>The value of such unofficial contacts between opposing sides is that they can often
de-escalate a conflict before any official negotiations can do so. These contacts can
build bridges between people, increase trust, and foster mutual understanding. They can
serve to correct misperceptions and unfounded fears, and can reverse the trend toward
dehumanization and the entrenchment of enemy images that often occurs in escalated
conflicts. Often the de-escalation that results from such contacts is necessary, before
official negotiations will be considered politically possible.</p>
