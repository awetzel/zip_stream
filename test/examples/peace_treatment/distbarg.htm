<p>Distributive bargaining is the approach to bargaining or negotiation that is used when
the parties are trying to divide something up--distribute something.&nbsp; It contrasts
with integrative bargaining in which the parties are trying to make more of something.
&nbsp; This is most commonly explained in terms of a pie.&nbsp; Disputants can work
together to make the pie bigger, so there is enough for both of them to have as much as
they want, or they can focus on cutting the pie up, trying to get as much as they can for
themselves.&nbsp; In general, integrative bargaining tends to be more cooperative, and
distributive bargaining more competitive. Common tactics include trying to gain an
advantage by insisting on negotiating on one's own home ground; having more negotiators
than the other side, using tricks and deception to try to get the other side to concede
more than you concede; making threats or issuing ultimatums; generally trying to force the
other side to give in by overpowering them or outsmarting them, not by discussing the
problem as an equal (as is done in integrative bargaining).&nbsp; The goal in distributive
bargaining is not to assure both sides win, but rather that one side (your side) wins as
much as it can, which generally means that the other side will lose, or at least get less
than it had wanted. (Distributive bargaining tactics rarely assume the pie will divided in
half.)</p>

<p>Often these approaches to negotiation are framed as incompatible.&nbsp; Fisher, Ury,
and Patton, authors of the negotiation best-seller <em><a href="../example/fish7513.htm">Getting
to Yes</a> </em>say that integrative bargaining is superior to distributive bargaining in
most, if not all, circumstances--even in situations in which something is to be divided
up.&nbsp; By cooperating and focusing on interests rather than positions, they argue that
the pie can almost always be enlarged or some other way can be found to provide gains for
all sides.&nbsp; Other theorists suggest this is naive--that distributive situations
requiring competitive or hard bargaining often occur.</p>

<p>Conflict theorists Lax and Sebenius have suggested that most negotiation actually
involves both integrative and distributive bargaining which they refer to as
&quot;creating value&quot; and &quot;claiming value.&quot;&nbsp; Negotiators should do as
much as they can to &quot;create value;&quot; once the pie is as big as they can make it,
they should claim as much of the value they can for themselves.&nbsp; Knowing which
approach to take when is what they refer to as the &quot;negotiators dilemma.&quot; </p>
