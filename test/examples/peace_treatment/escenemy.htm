<p><font SIZE="+2">In cases where intractable conflicts have escalated into intense
confrontations, it is common for the parties to have seriously hurt one another. These
injuries may involve psychological pain, property destruction, physical injury, and even
loss of life. As the parties struggle to find ways of avoiding such problems in the
future, they often look for someone to blame for the tragedy. In a great many cases, the
parties conclude that it is their enemies that are responsible, and the key to avoiding
such tragedies in the future is the development and maintenance of an ability to overpower
their enemies.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this way of thinking about the problem makes
continuing tension and destructive confrontations all but inevitable, as both sides race
to maximize their power base.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">An alternative way of framing the problem of destructive confrontation
views escalation as the &quot;enemy.&quot; This approach focuses upon the fact that the
conflict's destructiveness is largely the result of the parties' failure to take adequate
steps to control the destructive dynamics of escalation.&nbsp; Thus the way to avoid
destructive confrontations is not by building up one's power base, but by building &nbsp;
strategies to limit escalation.&nbsp; Framing the problem in this way creates a
co-operative situation in which the parties recognize that their future security depends
upon their willingness to work together to control escalation, rather than competing
against the other for dominance.&nbsp; Another advantage of this approach is that it does
not require the parties to compromise their core beliefs or reach agreement on the
underlying issues. All that is needed is a commitment to pursuing their conflict in more
constructive ways. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">While it would obviously be better for the parties to pursue such an
approach jointly, much can be achieved by one party working alone to limit escalation.
&nbsp; If just one side refuses to enter the provocation-counter-provocation spiral, the
spiral cannot continue to grow.&nbsp; Unilateral de-escalation efforts, such as<a
href="grit.htm"> GRIT</a>, can also help reduce escalation substantially, even if the
other side is slow to respond.</font></p>
