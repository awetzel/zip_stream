<p>Kenneth Boulding argued that power had <a href="../example/boul7514.htm">three
&quot;faces&quot;</a> or forms--threat, exchange, and what he called love. (We call the
third form of power the power of the integrative system.)&nbsp; Exchange power is the
power you get through cooperation--by giving something to another person or group, they
will give something back to you. &nbsp; Negotiation is one way of implementing exchange,
though exchange often happens in a much less formal way as well.&nbsp; The section on
exchange lists a variety of approaches that can be taken to initiate trades, and things
that can be done when the initial efforts do not seem to work.&nbsp; </p>
