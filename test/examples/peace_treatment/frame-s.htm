<p>Conflict scholars use the term &quot;framing&quot; to mean the process of describing
and interpreting an event. According to conflict theorist Jay Rothman, &quot;framing
focuses attention. When a frame is put around a painting, it gives the viewer a
focus.&quot; (Rothman, 1997, page 21) Conflict framing does the same thing. It helps the
parties understand and interpret what the conflict is about--what is going on and what
they should do about it. </p>

<p>The way one frames a conflict is based on many factors beyond what &quot;actually&quot;
happened. The way one interprets or frames a conflict is based on what has happened to
that person (or group of people) in the past, what values are important to them, and
whether they see the situation as a threat or a potential benefit. All of one's knowledge
and life experiences serve as a background--a view of the world and one's own place in
it-- upon which any new event is interpreted. Hence, these accumulated experiences shape
how any particular event is interpreted or &quot;framed.&quot;</p>

<p>The way one frames a conflict is important for many reasons. For one, it determines
whether a situation is seen as a conflict at all. If one person makes a rude comment to
another person, the recipient of the comment may take offense (thus framing the situation
as a conflict) while another might just ignore it, or laugh about it. </p>

<p>Secondly, one's frame determines what one will do about a situation. If a situation is
considered unimportant, it will probably be ignored. If the conflict is considered
important, however, the people involved need to decide how they are going to handle it. If
they think it is a resolvable problem, they may try to talk about it informally or try to
negotiate a solution. If they think it is only resolvable by force, then they are likely
to use that approach. </p>

<p>Often disputants frame conflicts in adversarial or win-lose terms. They assume that
they have a conflict of interests and that the only way to get what they want is if the
other party does not get what he or she wants. Rather than seeking a win-win solution,
they therefore seek ways to build their power so that they can force the other side to
give in. When both sides do this, the inevitable result is escalation, a hardening of
positions, an increased danger of destructive confrontation (perhaps even violence) and a
much diminished possibility of solving the problem. By reframing the conflict in a win-win
(or integrative way), the conflict can often be handled much more constructively. &nbsp;
Other constructive forms of framing are needs-based framing, fairness-based framing, and
interest-based framing.&nbsp; (There is considerable overlap in these approaches,
however).&nbsp; Joint reframing--an exercise in which the disputants work together to
define the nature of the problems is also often very effective in getting the conflict
defined in a more constructive way. When problems are incompatible, it is easy to see how
it would be extremely difficult to reach a mutually acceptable solution. </p>
