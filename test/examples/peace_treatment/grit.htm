<p>One approach to de-escalation is GRIT, an approach developed by Charles Osgood. &nbsp;
In his original writing he said it stood for &quot;graduated and reciprocated initiatives
in tension reduction; later he simplified this to gradual reduction in tension.&nbsp; The
basic idea is that disputant can initiate de-escalation by making a small, unilateral
(one-sided) concession to the other side, and at the same time, communicating a desire or
even an expectation that this gesture will be matched with an equal response from the
opponent.&nbsp; If the opponent does respond positively, the first party can make a second
concession, and a &quot;peace spiral&quot; is begun.&nbsp; If the first initiative is
ignored, Osgood suggests that it be followed by a second--or even a third--attempt.&nbsp;
These concessions should be designed to build trust, but should not be terribly costly
(materially or strategically), nor should they suggest weakness. &nbsp; However, they
should indicate a willingness to transform the conflict to a more cooperative and less
adversarial approach.</p>

<p>Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was one example of GRIT at work.&nbsp; Before
his trip, hostility and suspicion between Egypt and Israel was very high, and several wars
had already occurred.&nbsp; In 1977, Sadat announced that he wanted to visit Jerusalem to
increase trust and to diminish tensions between the two nations.&nbsp; The trip cost him
very little, while it greatly improved his image in Israel and with its allies, and led to
the historic Camp David Accords a year later.</p>

  <dd>This is an example of step-by-step peacebuilding at the grassroots (or local, citizen)
    level.&nbsp; Rather than attempting gradual de-escalation between leaders, these
    peacebuilding programs sought to slowing increase trust between citizens through the
    development of common activities.&nbsp; </dd>
