<p>There are at least three main strategies for dealing more sensibly with crisis
situations. First, mechanisms can be put into place which provide decision-makers with
much quicker access to reliable information. Crisis control centers offer one option.
&nbsp; In order to reduce the risk that military confrontation would result from
misinterpreting the meaning of military force movements, opposing countries can establish
crisis information centers with access to up-to-the-moment information about the status of
their respective military forces. Direct and instantaneous communication links between the
two centers provides a mechanism for correcting potentially dangerous misunderstandings
and negotiating crisis reduction steps. </p>

<p>Another common approach is contingency planning, in which the parties carefully think
about everything that could happen and then develop detailed plans for responding to each
situation. While it is important for the parties not become overly committed to these
contingency plans and retain a willingness to modify plans as the situation requires,
contingency planning can&nbsp; give the parties more time to identify and evaluate
alternative strategies. This prior evaluation can also make it easier to identify and
avoid strategies which can lead to crisis situations without good options. </p>

<p>Also important are steps which deliberately slow down the pace of the confrontation and
give the parties the more opportunities to carefully consider their options.&nbsp; For
example, military forces might be re-structured in ways which automatically impose delays
in crisis situations. In a situation where military forces are fully mobilized and facing
each other on the border, all-out hostilities could develop in a matter of
moments--denying the parties a chance to think things through carefully. This situation
might, however, be avoided by an agreement to station troops far from the border and
placing limits on the ability of each side transport soldiers to likely areas of combat.
This would create a more lengthy mobilization period in which the parties would have to
reassess the situation before before deciding on a course of action. </p>

<p>The introduction of delay-producing mechanisms is more problematic in situations where
delays might allow one or more parties to expand their power base sufficiently to alter
the outcome of a dispute. A classic example involves military units which are on the brink
of defeat. In this case, a cease-fire might give them the time to strengthen their
defenses, secure reinforcements, or mobilize world opinion against their opponent. The
party on the verge of victory might, understandably, oppose such delays.</p>

<p>Simulation exercises (often referred to as &quot;war games&quot; in the military
context) can also play a useful role. Such simulations can give key parties the chance to
practice their crisis decision making in much&nbsp; the same way that airline pilots use
simulators to practice dealing with emergencies. </p>

  <dd>Ury wrote this book to encourage U.S. citizens to pressure the President and Congress to
    set up additional crisis control measures--beyond the hotline--to try to prevent nuclear
    war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.&nbsp; Even though the Cold War is over, the
    suggestions Ury made are still highly appropriate for other tense international
    relationships.</dd>
