<p>If a society looks upon conflict as both friend and foe, it has a better chance of
preventing serious and costly types of conflict. Analytic conflict theory has much to
teach us about the dual nature of conflict. Simmel observes that social conflict may be as
important for a healthy society as cooperation. All group relations have positive elements
of attraction and negative ones of repulsion. Association and dissociation are facts of
social life. The forces of social integration usually tend to eclipse those which force us
apart. Society wants to stay together and thus ignores or suppresses conflict rather than
acknowledging and using it. Conflict's functions, Simmel would argue, should be as
prominent in how a society educates and trains its members as its dysfunctions. A society
should be as inventive with its ways of doing conflict at minimal cost to all the actors
concerned--nation states, groups, individuals--as it is with getting its members to
cooperate. The more inventive it is, the less likely that inevitable social tensions will
produce high-cost conflict.</p>
