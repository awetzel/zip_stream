<p>Dealing with serious conflict is a bit like emergency medicine. The first step is to
protect the injured person from further harm. Only then can one start the treatment and
then healing processes (surgery and recovery, for example). In violent conflict the first
step is to get people to stop hurting each other. This is often done by putting a neutral
intermediary between the fighting factions to physically keep them apart.&nbsp; This is
termed &quot;peacekeeping.&quot;&nbsp; Once the shooting has stopped, then political
leaders will sit down to try to negotiate a political resolution to the problem--which is
generally referred to as &quot;peacemaking.&quot;&nbsp; Lastly, efforts will be made to
diminish the hostility and the fear among the ordinary people--this is referred to as
peacebuilding.&nbsp; Sometimes the order of these activities is switched
around--peacekeeping may come after peacemaking, instituted as part of the settlement
agreement (for example, U.S. peacemakers entered the Sinai after the negotiation of the
Camp David Accords).&nbsp; At other times peacebuilding can take place before peacemaking
succeeds.&nbsp; This happens more and more as efforts are made to reconcile the
differences between citizens even when the governments cannot negotiate a settlement of
their differences.</p>

<p>Since peacekeeping principles are most generally applied to violent or at least
potentially violent confrontations, this topic will be discussed first. We will then show
how these basic principles can be extended to include non-violent types of force. </p>

<p>Most often peacekeeping is done by military personnel.&nbsp; In international conflicts
it is done with a neutral, usually multi-national force.&nbsp; Often these forces are
organized and sponsored by the United Nations and/or regional organizations such as the
Organization of American States (OAS) or the Organization of African Unity (OAU). &nbsp;
Typically, the forces are lightly or entirely unarmed--they work through persuasion and
moral force, not physical force.&nbsp; Their job is to monitor cease-fires, patrol
demilitarized zones, and to create buffer zones between fighting forces, so that the
fighting will stop.&nbsp; Sometimes they are assisted by other, non-military personnel
such as police offers, humanitarian aid workers, and/or citizen diplomats and peace
workers.</p>

<p>Since they are only lightly armed, peacekeepers cannot succeed unless the warring
parties want to stop fighting.&nbsp; If they do not, there is little peacekeepers can do.
If they stay in between the groups, they are likely to get killed.&nbsp; In this case, the
sponsoring organization needs to withdraw the peacekeepers, and consider undertaking what
is called &quot;an enforcement action&quot; instead, where well-armed troops move in to
stop a war.&nbsp; (This occurred in Gulf war, in Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and Albania, for example.)</p>

<p>In addition to the cooperation of the parties, several other factors are important to
the success of peacekeeping operations.&nbsp; One is the provision of adequate resources.
&nbsp; The UN has often had a difficult time getting the help it needs--either in terms of
manpower, or in terms of equipment for the peacekeepers--from the member states. &nbsp;
This has meant that UN peacekeeping forces are often much smaller than what is needed and
more poorly equipped.&nbsp; Needless to say, such shortages compromise
effectiveness.&nbsp; A second problem is the peacekeeper's mandate--what they are told
they are supposed to do.&nbsp; When their mandate is relatively narrow and clear--when
they are just supposed to keep the warring factions apart--they have generally been
successful.&nbsp; When their directives are broader and less clear--when they are asked to
provide humanitarian assistance, police protection, election monitoring, and a host of
other services for which they are not equipped or trained--their effectiveness has not
been as great.&nbsp; Problems also arise when peacekeepers find themselves being drawn
into the conflict on one side.</p>
