<hr>

<p>Often responsibility for serious acts of injustice and criminal behavior lies with a
few individuals and not the larger group or society to which these individuals belong. In
these cases, it is generally more desirable to direct counter-force strategies upon those
&quot;responsible&quot; individuals and not the larger community. In extreme cases this
may involve criminal prosecution by war crimes tribunals for &quot;crimes against
humanity.&quot; In less extreme cases the guilty parties can be tried under domestic laws
for handling conflict in a socially unacceptable way. </p>

<p>For example, individuals who kill civil rights leaders as part of a personal campaign
to preserve a segregated society can be tried for murder and people who take hostages can
be tried for kidnapping. Criminal prosecution can also be used against those who abuse the
court system by filing unfounded and frivolous cases to harass opponents. People can also
be tried for bribery or unfair election practices. &nbsp; There are also cases in which
larger police, military, or paramilitary organizations are responsible for criminal
behavior. In these cases military action or a change of leadership may be required before
criminal proceedings can begin.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One of the most difficult dilemmas facing new regimes is deciding who to prosecute, and
who to forgive, or whether a blanket amnesty should be granted to people on the opposing
side in an effort to put past difficulties &quot;behind us.&quot;&nbsp; Criminal
prosecution of human rights abusers gives the victims some sense of finality and justice;
but at the same time, it discourages perpetrators from coming forward with the truth about
what really happened, which is also necessary for reconciliation.&nbsp; Widespread
criminal prosecution also can lead to a prolonged conflict between the groups.&nbsp; If
military personnel or civilians think that they are likely to be dealt with harshly by a
new regime, they are likely to fight harder to prevent that new regime from gaining
control, and they can continue to oppose the new regime after it is installed.&nbsp; This
can prolong a conflict--and the associated human rights abuses--longer than it might have
otherwise gone on.&nbsp; </p>
