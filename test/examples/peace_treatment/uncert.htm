<p><font SIZE="+2">Because of society's enormous complexity, is impossible for scientific
and technical studies to fully and accurately predict the consequences of pursuing
alternative strategies for resolving a dispute. This does not, however, mean that the
experts know nothing or that formal and scientific studies of available options are
useless. They key is to separate what is known (or can be found out) from questions that
cannot be accurately and reliably answered.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">For example, experts might be able to determine that a particular area
will never be subjected to flooding. They might also be able to determine that another
area has somewhere between 1 chance in 20 and 1 chance in 200 of being flooded in any
particular year. With additional research they might be able to to reduce this risk to the
point where the chance of flooding is, for example, somewhere between 1/60 and 1/80.
&nbsp; But they will never be able to say, &quot;this area is flood-safe.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">The next step is to successfully incorporate strategies for dealing
with uncertainty into the dispute resolution process. In general the key to dealing with
uncertainty is to retain as much flexibility as possible.&nbsp; Rather than locking
oneself into a course of action which might&nbsp; prove disastrous, try to make decisions
that can adjust for changes in the environment or knowledge which occurs in the future.
&nbsp; An alternative approach is insurance, which compensates people who get harmed by an
unexpected or unlikely occurrence.&nbsp; Insurance programs might, for example, be set up
to assist victims of any flood.&nbsp; Risk avoidance is another approach.&nbsp; People
might, for example, decide to reduce flood risks by not building in the floodway or by
constructing buildings on stilts capable of resisting floods.</font></p>

  <dt><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="7502" --> <strong><a href="../example/sand7502.htm">Peter M. Sandman--Explaining Environmental Risk</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This article explains that the public assesses risk and uncertainty very differently
    from experts.&nbsp; It then suggests ways in which risk can be explained to the public so
    that they can make informed decisions. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="6038 " --><a HREF="../example/fish6038.htm"><strong>Roger
    Fischer, Elizabeth Kopelman and Andrea Schneider -- Consider the Other Side's Choice</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This short essay illustrates a method to assess the consequences of various actions.
    &nbsp; Had this been used by Saddam Hussein in the Gulf Crisis, the authors argue, the
    uncertainty about choices would have been clearer, and perhaps the war could have been
    avoided.</dd>
