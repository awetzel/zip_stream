<p>Escalation and the intense emotions and anger it generates seem, fortunately, to be
somewhat unstable. In the absence of a continuing provocation, the level of escalation
tends to diminish. This suggests that one goal of de-escalation efforts is to simply to
limit the number and frequency of provocation, which allows more time for de-escalatory
efforts to have the time they need to succeed.&nbsp; In addition, replacing provocative
statements and language with de-escalatory language can be very helpful.</p>

<p>For example, it is useful to replace accusatory &quot;you&quot; statements with less
provocative <a href="istate.htm">&quot;I&quot; statements</a>. Also, parties should try to
resist the temptation to insult their opponents, and make exaggerated statements about the
threats they present. Here it is common for the members of the group to compete for
position within the group by promising to&nbsp; take the toughest stand against the
group's enemies. This, in turn, results in a kind of race in which leaders compete with
one another by making ever-more extreme and provocative statements. Not surprisingly,
opponents are likely to respond with their own provocations. What is needed are leaders
who are willing to tone down their rhetoric by explaining their constituents that this
kind of de-escalatory approach is more likely to advance their interests than more
inflammatory, &quot;hard line&quot; approaches. </p>

<p>Even more beneficial are <a href="disarm.htm">disarming statements</a>. Here the
parties make surprisingly conciliatory statements which their opponent would never have
believed possible. If the seriousness of these statements can be demonstrated, it becomes
possible to establish a de-escalatory spiral in which opposing parties compete to prove
that their peaceful intentions are as strong as their opponents'.&nbsp; If this is to
work, however, it is important that the statements be backed up by corresponding actions.</p>
