<p>One reason escalation occurs so quickly is that most people do not understand how or
why it occurs or why it is so dangerous.&nbsp; They often even encourage escalation
intentionally, in an effort to gain support for their own side.&nbsp; By teaching people
about escalation, they are better able to make careful strategic choices.&nbsp; They can
mobilize support for their cause in ways that do not unnecessarily antagonize the
opposition; they can temper their language and make other efforts to avoid provocative or
otherwise escalatory actions when they understand what those are and what their effects
are likely to be.&nbsp; The easiest way to do this is to include a unit on escalation (and
de-escalation) in standard conflict management training programs, as well as training
programs on advocacy, community organizing, and similar empowerment strategies.&nbsp; Once
people understand the dangers--as well as the benefits--of escalation, and understand what
kinds of actions tend to cause unintentional escalation, they will be much more able to
prevent escalation from occurring (or at least will be able to limit it) than the can if
they do not understand what causes it or how it affects them.</p>
