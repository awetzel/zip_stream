<p>Having a good structure and process for meetings is critical if the desired outcomes
are to be obtained.&nbsp; Important questions to consider include the following:</p>

<p>1)&nbsp; What is the purpose of the meeting?&nbsp; The meeting organizer should be
clear what the goals of the meeting are, and should make these clear at the outset. &nbsp;
Often the initial goal is simply getting people together and allowing them to become
familiar with each other and more trusting of each other.&nbsp; As this goal is
accomplished the meeting participants may work together to develop further joint goals for
the initial or future meetings.</p>

<p>2) Who is to attend the meeting?&nbsp; If the critical parties are not represented at
the meeting, no decisions can be made until they are consulted.&nbsp; This makes the
meeting a waste of time for the people who are there.&nbsp; Yet sometimes it helps to
exclude people or organizations from meetings, if they are likely to be obstructionists.
&nbsp; Deciding who to include when is often a difficult decision.</p>

<p>3) When and where should the meeting be held?&nbsp; Facilities need to be comfortable
and convenient.&nbsp; Often a neutral location is superior to having a meeting on anyone's
&quot;home&quot; ground.&nbsp; Even decisions about the shape of the table can have
significant impact on the meeting's outcome.&nbsp; Square or rectangular tables which
allow each side to stick together and face the other can create a more adversarial
atmosphere than round tables or other seating arrangements in which everyone is scattered
or otherwise seated together, rather than in opposing groups.</p>

<p>4) Are observers and/or the media to be allowed?&nbsp; Often private meetings will
yield more fruitful discussions than ones which are open to the public or the media,
although the public's desire to know what is going on in meetings that affect them must be
accommodated in some way.</p>

<p>5) What procedural ground rules are to be followed?&nbsp; All meetings need to have
some ground rules--about who sets the agenda and how, who moderates the meeting, who
speaks when and about what,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; Often the person convening the meeting will
suggest an initial set of ground rules, which can be altered by those in attendance if
they all agree.</p>

<p>6)&nbsp; Who enforces the ground rules, and what happens when they are broken? &nbsp;
Often a gentle reminder from the meeting facilitator or another meeting participant will
be sufficient to get ground rules followed, but procedures need to be designated if this
does not work.</p>
