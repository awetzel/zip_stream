<p>Parties often focus exclusively upon their immediate, short-term dispute in the belief
that short-term victory will resolve the conflict once and for all. &nbsp; This seldom
happens in intractable conflicts, however. Even when short term victory is obtained,
future related disputes are likely to follow.&nbsp; Often parties with a short-term focus
find themselves unprepared for the next dispute which arises when their opponent, who was
inspired by the <a href="../problem/forop2-p.htm">backlash effect,</a> launches a more
powerful counter-attack.&nbsp; In this sense, pursuing an effective long-term strategy is
likely to be essential for both empowered and disempowered parties. </p>

<p>A strategy of long-term struggle is also the best option available to parties who do
not have the power, over the short term, that they need to resist the forced-based
strategies of their opponents. By slowly working to build up their forcing power, exchange
power, and integrative power, they can put themselves in a stronger position for the
upcoming disputes.&nbsp; Often progress is slow, but modest improvements in one's position
can be made with each successive dispute. Such a slow approach is also likely to generate
less resistance (backlash) from the opponent--thus the end result may be more is gained
faster than with a strong struggle initially.&nbsp; In addition to providing a slow
advance in one's position, the long-term approach provides time for integrative strategies
to change the underlying relationship between the parties in ways which may begin to
resolve the underlying issues and reconcile the adversaries. </p>

<p>A long-term strategy for a minority, disempowered group might, for example, start with
efforts to draw national and international attention to their problems and the injustices
they face.&nbsp; Here they will likely be most effective if they stress violations of
generally recognized principles of justice, not affronts that are likely to seem justified
by others who are not in their group.&nbsp; As public awareness and support for their
plight grows, the disempowered group might try to organize an economic boycott against
their oppressors. They might also initiate a series of lawsuits designed to set legal
precedents that will eventually permit them to challenge the injustice directly. (This is
the strategy that the NAACP used in building its legal challenge to racial segregation in
the United States.) The parties might also engage in coalition-building efforts aimed at
eventually electing sympathizers to public office. While none of these approaches, alone,
will work to remedy the injustice, nor will any of these approaches work quickly, together
they are likely to make progress, which a short term violent approach is unlikely to do.</p>

<p>While some societies seem to adapt very easily to this long-term approach, others,
including the United States, seem to prefer a short-term strategy focused upon finding a
quick solution. People in these cultures are often more likely to pursue a &quot;quick
fix&quot; approach, even when prospects for success are not good. </p>
