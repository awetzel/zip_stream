<p>It is often useful to explore the reasons why people hold the positions that they do.
Usually the positions are seen as a way of obtaining more fundamental interests or
needs--the real things the disputants want or need. </p>

<p>For example, a group may say it wants full autonomy and independence from the national
government, but it might really be more interested in a strong sense of identity and
security, as well as equal treatment within the social, economic, and political system.
The group assumes that the only way to obtain identity, security, and equal treatment is
to become independent. Usually, however, such demands for independence are viewed as
unacceptable by the national government, leading to an intractable conflict. </p>

<p>If the group's needs for security, identity, and equal treatment can be met without
granting full independence, however, new approaches might be developed for solving
seemingly intractable problems. While this is certainly not easy, reframing the problem
from a simple yes-no decision on independence, to a more complex question which examines
the grievances and needs of the group seeking independence, and seeks ways to meet those
needs while meeting the interests and needs of the other side as well can yield new and
often more fruitful approaches to problem solving.</p>

<p>While meeting human needs often requires substantial changes to a society's social,
political, or economic structure, such changes can often be made in a way that benefits
all sides. Unlike interests, which really may be structured in a win-lose way (meaning
that the more one side gets, the less the other side gets), needs are often mutually
reinforcing: the more secure one side of a conflict feels, the less it will feel a need to
threaten the other side, thus the more secure the other side will feel as well. Thus,
integrative solutions (solutions which bring the two sides together in a win-win
agreement) are often more likely in a needs-based conflict than a high-stakes win-lose
interest-based conflict.</p>

<p>The key to reframing conflicts on the basis of needs is identifying those needs in the
first place. This requires careful analysis of the conflict, and an examination of why
people are taking the positions they are. By asking one's self or one's group &quot;why do
we want that?&quot; enough times, one will likely ultimately get down to the fundamental
human need. (If asked &quot;why do you want to feel secure&quot; the answer is likely to
be a simple &quot;because I do,&quot; rather than anything more elaborate than that. That
is because security is a fundamental need-it doesn't have a more basic root.</p>

    Post-Cold War Era</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Sahnoun examines military and humanitarian interventions in civil and ethnic conflicts.
    He sees insecurity as the underlying cause of these conflicts and argues that much
    progress can be made in terms of conflict prevention and resolution by framing these
    conflicts in terms of security and insecurity and trying to structure interventions so
    that security is increased, not decreased. </dd>
