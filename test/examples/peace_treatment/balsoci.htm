<p>Balanced sociation would be a conscious effort by a society to make both cooperation
and conflict prominent in public consciousness, formal education, and public investment.
The assumption would be that a continuing tension between the two is important for stable
and productive social relations. Aho (1994) speaks of &quot;tension-wisdom&quot;
developing within a society like the United States; its members growing increasingly
tolerant of disagreement and difference and learning how to live with it more creatively
and productively.&nbsp; An important requisite for a society with its positive and
negative relations in balance would be a relatively equitable distribution of wealth and
life chances across the social structure. Another guarantor of balanced sociation would be
the presence of what Coser (1956) has termed &quot;safety valve&quot; mechanisms,
institutions permitting social and interpersonal conflict at minimal cost: nonviolent
social movements; institutional third parties such as court systems and mediators;
ritualized conflict in sport; training in non-injurious defense and fighting methods such
as the martial arts.&nbsp; Balanced sociation could be produced through a society's
education process. Skills at opposing constructively would be taught alongside those of
cooperating and &quot;getting along.&quot; Relations with one's opponent would be
understood in both their associative and dissociative dimensions. Both competitive and
cooperative conflict resolution would be taught as art forms in the schools. Mediators,
arbitrators, national defense specialists and other conflict professionals would learn how
to balance sociation in their work.&nbsp; </p>
