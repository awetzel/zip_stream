<p>Cooling-off periods are used in highly emotional confrontations in which one or more of
the parties has become intensely angry as the result of some real or imagined provocation.
Use of this technique grew out of the realization that people who are angry and who may
have suffered physical or emotional injuries are likely to make decisions about conflict
which they will later regret. Professional intermediaries also recognize the problem. They
know that, in angry and emotional situations, the chances of reaching a settlement or even
making significant progress are almost non-existent. Conflict decisions made under these
circumstances are also likely to make the situation worse rather than better. </p>

<p>In principle, the solution is very simple: agree to a mutual pause in the confrontation
(or a recess in the negotiations) so that everyone has a chance to think about what has
happened and carefully develop their response strategy. This does not mean that the
parties are being asked to forget the events that made them so angry--they are merely
being given time to think carefully about how best to approach the situation. </p>

<p>In the United States, the classic application of the technique is in labor management
negotiations, in which a third party (or the two parties themselves) may call for a
cooling-off period. During this cooling-off period, the parties are expected to return to
business as usual. There can also be an understanding that the terms of the eventual
settlement will be applied retroactively to the cooling-off period, so the parties will
not lose gains if they wait to pursue the conflict.&nbsp; This approach can be applied in
other conflict situations as well, including public policy negotiations, or family
conflicts. Crisis management techniques designed to slow down the pace of the conflict can
also be helpful in fulfilling cooling off function.</p>
