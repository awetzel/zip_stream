<p align="left">Procedural problems must be treated by determining what is generally
considered to be &quot;fair&quot; (both in general, and in this case in particular) and
then following those procedures.&nbsp; In democratic societies, usually justice or
fairness involves giving people who are affected by a decision some input into that
decision (though they may not have control). This may occur by utilizing some form of
administrative decision making following public input, majority rule decision making
(either direct or through a legislature), or with a consensus process in which
representatives of interest groups work together to try to develop a solution that meets
everyone's needs enough that all groups will approve the decision.&nbsp; Regardless of the
process used, &quot;fairness&quot; also generally involves following standard procedures,
so that people know how decisions are made and what to expect (at least in terms of the
process).&nbsp; Attempts to short-cut the process to try to avoid dissent, or to draw out
the process so long that people give up are both likely to be viewed with suspicion.
&nbsp; Thus, developing a reasonable procedure and timeline, and then sticking with it is
important.&nbsp; Many other techniques are also available for treating a wide variety of
procedural problems--<a href="../!treating_overlays.htm#process">click here </a>to read
