<p>Many intractable conflicts not only have a history, but they also are sufficiently
involved and complex that they are related to other external situations--often to other
disputes.&nbsp; For example, a dispute between two countries may start over a minor
incident involving a foreign national in the other country, but can quickly escalate
because many other issues--even involving other countries--are involved.&nbsp; Just as
biologists explain that the entire world is linked into one great ecosystem, and you
cannot change one thing without affecting other parts of the system, so too is the social
system inter-related.&nbsp; Thus it is important to recognize what other situations and
disputes are related to the immediate situation you are involved in and how those other
situations are likely to affect you and your own conflict.</p>

  <dt><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="1058 " --><a HREF="../example/ande1058.htm"><strong>Mary
    Anderson -- Humanitarian NGOs in Conflict Intervention</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Anderson suggests that NGOs sometimes do not recognize the scope of the situation they
    are involved in, who else is doing what, and how they may be contributing to the conflict
    rather than helping to moderate it.</dd>

    of Ethiopia</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This article presents a case study of Lederach's theory of nested conflicts.&nbsp; This
    theory reflects the notion that many intractable conflicts are really many different
    conflicts and disputes which are interrelated.</dd>

    Middle East</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In this case related disputes prevented de-escalation of the conflict in the Middle
    East.&nbsp; Not until the Cold War subsided was significant progress made in that region.</dd>
