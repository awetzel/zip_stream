<p><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="The most fundamental framing problem is deciding when an underlying source of frustration should become viewed as a conflict. Every person has a long list of things that other people do that they do not like and would like to see changed. A key aspect of framing is deciding which of these many sources of frustration should be actively opposed and treated as a conflict and which sources of frustration should simply be accepted as an undesirable fact of life. Since people have the energy to pursue only a few conflicts it is important that they pursue those conflicts that they wisely decide which conflicts are worth pursuing.
This distinction between underlying frustration and active conflict is similar to the main distinction that sociologists between manifest and latent conflict. **INSERT link to Paul's write up. " --></p>
