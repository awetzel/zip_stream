<p>Establishing personal relationships with people on the other side of the conflict can
help lessen many of the problems related to conflict escalation, and can be a forerunner
to official negotiations and conflict resolution. By establishing personal relationships,
stereotypes are broken down, and people come to see the &quot;enemy&quot; as a real,
living, breathing, feeling, caring person, not just an abstract, hostile, evil enemy. Once
this change of attitude takes place, mutual understanding and trust can slowly be
developed between adversaries. Although the parties still may have divergent interests or
unmet needs, they can reach the point where they understand that their problem is a mutual
one, and must be solved by cooperating, not competing or trying to destroy the other. </p>

<p>One of the biggest conflict resolution problems is &quot;scaling up&quot; such
transformed personal relationships from individual people to the disputing societies
overall. Personal relationships between individuals can change rather quickly, but
replicating these changes among entire populations is a very slow and difficult process.
The more opportunities there are for people to develop personal relationships with people
on the other side of the conflict, the better off both sides will be. Citizen exchanges,
dialogues, joint projects, sporting events&#150;any opportunities which can be provided to
bring people together in a positive, cooperative way should be encouraged. (Although
sporting events are competitive, they have a set of rules which govern the competition
that requires fair play and mutual respect. Thus, even such competitive events can be seen
as cooperative endeavors as well.)</p>

<p>The only time in which personal relationships can be more harmful than helpful is when
the people have a long history of disliking or distrusting each other that they cannot get
beyond. For example, Jimmy Carter quickly found that bringing Anwar Sadat and Menachem
Begin together at Camp David was not productive. After a failed attempt at negotiations
the first day, Carter used shuttle diplomacy for the rest of the two week process at Camp
David, believing that Begin and Sadat would never be able to work effectively together
face-to-face. Yet Carter&#146;s own strong personal relationship with Sadat and with some
of Begin&#146;s assistants was key to his success.</p>
