<p>Force-based (and non-force based) options available to the parties vary considerably
depending upon the context of the conflict and dispute. At the broadest level there is an
important distinction between conflicts which are carried out within the context of
established and broadly accepted political and legal systems and conflicts which occur
outside of these systems. In the first case the ultimate source of power is a party's
ability to secure political decisions or legal judgments which result in the application
of the enforcement powers of the police.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second case the ultimate
source of&nbsp; forced-based power is violence.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>There are, however, numerous cases in which exchange or integrative systems are even
more powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, taboos associated with the integrative system
often prevent people from using violence even when they have power&nbsp; to do so
successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mutually beneficial exchanges are also often negotiated&nbsp; in
situations were no limits exist on the use of violent force by the parties.</p>

<h3>Political, Legal and Other Institutional Structures Which Limit Violence</h3>

<p>Different countries structure the political and legal systems which limit violence in
different ways. There are, for example, important differences between societies organized
around parliamentary democracies and those organized around congressional systems like the
United States. There are also variations in the individual political and economic rights
which different societies afford their citizens and the comparative role played by the
public and private sectors (the percentage of the economy which is managed by the
government). Litigation processes are also used to varying degrees with different
societies with vastly different proportions of the work force engaged in the legal
profession. </p>

<p>While political and legal institutions constitute (for most practical purposes) the
ultimate source of power within such societies, there are a great many conflicts and
disputes which are played out using other institutional mechanisms. In some cases the
parties may voluntarily agree to resolve any disputes which arise through a system of
binding arbitration. Business opportunities are largely pursued through negotiation
process (though the contractual agreements resulting from these processes may be enforced
in the civil courts). Interpersonal conflicts are usually played out less formally,
without intervention by political and legal institutions. </p>

<p>There are also a great many informal dispute handling institutions which play roles of
varying importance depending upon the situation and the society. Differing religious and
cultural groups often have often employee traditional but highly effective dispute
handling mechanisms involving religious leaders, community elders, and others. Many parts
of the world are also making increasing use of alternative dispute resolution processes.
In the United States, for example, the courts often require contending parties to try
mediation before they can proceed with litigation.</p>

<p>Also of great&nbsp; importance are social taboos against the use of violence as a
conflict strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there are a few pacifists that morally
oppose violence under any circumstances,&nbsp; there are many more people who consider
violence acceptable only as a last resort and only has a defense against violent acts
initiated by others</p>

<h3>Conflicts Which Occur Without Violence Limiting Structures</h3>

<p>There are also numerous conflicts which occur outside of established political systems.
In these cases the ultimate source of power is not the police with its monopoly upon
overwhelming physical violence. Instead it is the ability of the parties to successfully
use physical force against opponents. Such violence-based conflicts can arise in a number
of settings. One such setting involves conflicts between nations and, often, international
alliances the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the coalition of forces which opposed
Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.</p>

<p>Physical force is also the ultimate source of power in situations where the legitimacy
of political and legal institutions has collapsed and societies are sliding into anarchy
and civil war. This is an especially serious problem for societies which are undergoing
revolutionary change. In these cases old and widely discredited conflict resolution
institutions are often discarded before broadly supported new institutions are available
to replace them. The result may be a situation in which the most violent faction has an
advantage. </p>

<p>Violent approaches to conflict are also common in small-scale interpersonal disputes
which are often so minor that they are not addressed by political and legal institutions
(at least not until violence becomes severe enough to be considered criminal.) This
category includes family violence and simple flights.</p>

<p>The section on&nbsp; force explores both violent and nonviolent types of force while
the section on the integrative and exchange (trading) systems discusses other nonviolent
sources of power.</p>
