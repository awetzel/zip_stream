<p>In cases where joint fact-finding efforts are unworkable, oversight or independent
review committees may provide an effective alternative for determining the credibility of
fact-finding efforts. Here, the strategy is fairly simple. A group wishing to determine
the validity of factual information simply hires experts which it trusts and pays them to
review the information and tell them whether or not they think that it is believable. </p>

<p>These experts can begin by reviewing the information and, especially, descriptions of
the methods used to obtain it. They can then determine whether or not the methods used
conform with established research methods. In conducting this review, it may be useful for
the experts to meet with the people who actually did the fact-finding study. The next step
is to check study findings against other sources of similar information to determine
whether or not the results are consistent with well-established facts. Here it may be
appropriate for experts to attempt to replicate or duplicate key aspects of the study. </p>

<p>The biggest problem with this approach is that it is expensive. This means that some
mechanism must be found for providing less wealthy parties with the funds that they need
to pay their experts. Sometimes the government or wealthier parties may be able provide
grants for this purpose.&nbsp; However, in providing the money, it is important that
interest groups be able to spend the money on experts that they trust.&nbsp; Otherwise,
the money and the effort will be wasted. </p>

<p>Other problems arise when key parties are completely unfamiliar with the use of
technical information and strategies for consulting with experts.&nbsp;They will need to
find someone who is adept at explaining technical information to non-technical audiences.
&nbsp; Problems can also arise when interest groups select experts who will tell them what
they want to hear and employ unreliable methods to reach their conclusions. </p>

  <dd>In this case study, each of the parties initially collected their own data which led to
    a credibility problem. The problem was resolved by having a third party--the U.S. Army
    Corps of&nbsp; Engineers--do a fact-finding study that was jointly designed by the parties
    and the Corps, and carefully monitored by each of the parties' experts to make sure it was
    accurately done.</dd>
