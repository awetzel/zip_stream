<p>In order for force to be viewed as legitimate, its use must be based upon moral
principles which all parties believe in. In other words, force must be more than an excuse
for pursuing purely selfish objectives. (This topic is discussed extensively on the
section on<a href="treatint.htm"> integrative systems</a><a href="integrat.htm">.</a>)&nbsp;
In general, it is more desirable for force to be administered locally by forcing parties
with similar cultural traditions which are acting on behalf of the larger community. For
example, community policing policies seek police officers who are members of the community
that they patrol and not outsiders. (Still, this is not an absolute rule, and there may be
cases in which <a href="extintvn.htm">external intervention</a> is the best available
option.) When force is used beyond the local level, it generally works better if it is
reserved for situations in which most, if not all, parties would recognize that its use is
legitimate--for example to enforce the maintenance of international laws or treaties.
&nbsp; </p>

<p>Force is also more like to be viewed as legitimate if it is only used as a last resort
against parties who have violated widely accepted rules of behavior. Such rules would
prohibit actions which peers are likely to view as absolutely unacceptable, even within a
context which tolerates and embraces diversity and group differences.&nbsp; For example,
use of force against military forces involved an unacceptable behavior is more widely seen
as more legitimate than the use of force used against innocent civilians. This is one
reason why military forces often try to avoid attacking civilian targets. (There are,
unfortunately also cases in which war is waged against civilians and terrible <a
href="../problem/human_rights.htm">war crimes</a> are committed.)&nbsp; Concern about
harming innocent civilians also limits the legitimacy of economic sanctions in many cases.</p>

<p>The legitimacy of using force is increased when the parties use the least destructive
type of force which is also consistent with an effective defense of their interests. For
example, an attempt to work within existing laws should precede efforts to change those
laws by political or other means. Similarly, diplomatic solutions should be pursued before
military solutions.&nbsp; It is also generally wise to employ a <a href="ngloops.htm">negotiation
loopback</a> strategy in which the parties set reasonable conditions under which they
would be willing to return to the negotiating table and compromise, after force has made
the relative power relationships clear.</p>

<p>Legitimizing the use of force also requires that the parties publicly explain and
justify their actions. Without such justifications, it is easy for misunderstandings to
arise which threaten legitimacy. </p>

<p>Since force is often used in illegitimate ways, one important key to increasing the
constructiveness of conflict processes is to develop increasingly effective, but
legitimate, strategies for opposing illegitimate uses of force. Although force used in
self-defense is generally considered legitimate, it still tends to escalate conflicts
further and prolong their duration.&nbsp; Consideration should therefore be given to
developing stronger and better nonviolent ways of countering force--among these are
utilizing <a href="extintvn.htm">external intervention </a>, <a href="civdefs.htm">civilian
defense</a>, and/or <a href="nonviolc.htm">nonviolent sanctions</a> instead of
automatically using force to oppose all other force.</p>
