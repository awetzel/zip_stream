<p><font SIZE="+2">As conflicts escalate, leaders often make extremely strong statements
to their constituents indicating that they will never negotiate with their enemies and
will never compromise their position. Sooner or later it becomes clear that efforts to
de-escalate the conflict and develop a more constructive relationship are going to require
them to break these promises. This can be extremely hard to do since it makes them
vulnerable to attacks from opponents who can claim that they are being &quot;soft on the
enemy.&quot; They are likely to be especially reluctant to take these political risks if
they are not sure that their efforts will lead to a more peaceful relationship. In these
cases,&nbsp; some type of private negotiation process is likely to provide a safer way of
exploring options. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">There are several ways in which the private meetings can be held.
First, they can be conducted by unofficial, non-governmental representatives who do not
formally speak for the leadership. (This is often referred to as <a href="citdip.htm">&quot;track
two&quot; or &quot;citizen&quot; diplomacy</a>, as opposed to official <a
href="track1.htm">&quot;track one&quot; diplomacy</a>.) In these cases leaders can avoid
the initial, risky stages of the negotiation process and become formally involve only when
success seems probable. There can also be an intermediate phase involving mid-level
officials in the negotiations. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">There is also widespread recognition of the fact that it is very hard
to negotiate when everything that is said is made public. For this reason, people are
often support private negotiation sessions, provided that there is future opportunity for
meaningful public involvement in the process. Secrecy that is unexpectedly and suddenly
imposed is more likely to generate suspicion that unacceptable actions are being
&quot;covered up.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Confidentiality rules can also be used to clearly prohibit public
disclosure of information about a negotiation. This can, in turn, make it harder for
parties to use the media to pressure their opponents to make concessions.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">In cases involving small numbers of private parties (instead of large
scale public policy conflicts), the parties may decide to negotiate privately and keep
their settlements secret. This enables them to avoid telling their friends and associates
details about their problems and conflicts, while also avoiding embarrassing admissions
and the release of potentially damaging information.&nbsp; In the United States,
alternative dispute resolution processes (such as mediation and arbitration) are popular,
in large part because they are private, and allow the parties confidentiality regarding
both their problem and the settlement they develop.</font></p>
