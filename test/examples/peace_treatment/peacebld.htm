<p>Peacebuilding involves establishing normalized relations between ordinary citizens on
both sides of a conflict. Although it can be done at any time, peacebuilding efforts
usually follow peacekeeping (the enforced prevention of further violence) and peacemaking
(the forging of an actual settlement agreement). Unlike peacekeeping which can be
implemented relatively quickly, and peace-making, which can occur over a period of a few
months, peacebuilding usually takes a number of years. John Paul Lederah, an expert on
peacebuilding, has observed that it takes people at least as long to get out of a conflict
as it does to get into one--and some of the conflicts he has been involved in have gone on
for decades, or even centuries. So peacebuilding is a very long, slow process.</p>

<p>Peacebuilding usually involves efforts to increase &quot;normal,&quot; cooperative
contacts between opponents. Stephen Ryan explains that peacekeeping &quot;builds barriers
between warriors,&quot; while peacebuilding &quot;builds bridges between the ordinary
people.&quot; Efforts are made to open channels of communication, get people involved in
joint projects, work with the media and the educational system to try to break down
stereotypes and reduce prejudice and discrimination. The goal of all of these efforts is
reconciliation--getting the people to accept each other as part of their own group or be
reconciled to mutual co-existence and tolerance. </p>

<p>Often peacebuilding programs are carried out by nongovernmental organizations, but the
United Nations and regional organizations such as the Organization of American States or
the Organization for African Unity have engaged in peacebuilding efforts as well. Some
examples of these are given below. </p>

    Transitional Justice</strong></a><font FACE="New York,Times New Roman"></dt>
  <dd>This is an article about the dilemmas new governments face regarding peacebuilding and
    reconciliation efforts with the old regime. Arguments can be made that the old regime
    should be prosecuted for past human rights abuses; equally valid arguments can be made
    that the old regime should be granted amnesty from prosecution. Regardless of the path
    chosen, the author cautions that failing to deal adequately with transitional justice
    issues will be very costly over the long term.</dd>

    CIAV(International Commission for Support and Verification), a commission formed by the
    Organization of American States to oversee the demobilization and disarmament of the
    National Resistance in Nicaragua, and to carry out their reintegration into Nicaraguan

    Sahnoun compares official peacebuilding with NGO efforts, observing that NGOs can often be
    more successful at peacebuilding because they are more flexible in the kinds of activities
    they can undertake.</dd>
