<h1 ALIGN="center">Strategic Option Identification and Costing</h1>

<hr>

<p>The principal underlying option inventory and costing is fairly simple.&nbsp; Parties
should systematically&nbsp; assemble a list of ALL the options which they believe are
available for advancing their interests, including ones which they don't usually consider
or utilize, but which might be effective in this case&nbsp; (this includes <a href="texchnge.htm">exchange-based</a> and <a href="intopts.htm">integrative options</a>
as well as <a href="inventory.htm">force based options</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>They then need to estimate the costs and benefits of pursuing each option.&nbsp; This
requires an assessment of one's ability to implement the option (with or without outside
help), the likely costs of implementing that approach, and the probable reactions and
response of opponents and decision makers.&nbsp;(Extremely negative or antagonistic
responses raise the cost of the strategy.)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is also important to try to anticipate future disputes.&nbsp;Options which produce
short-term victory may not be very desirable if they also strengthen the backlash effect
in ways which increase the number future disputes and reduce one's chances of protecting
one's interests in those situations&nbsp; </p>
