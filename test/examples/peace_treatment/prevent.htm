<p>This is a very broad topic that does not really fit with our incremental approach, but
so much is being written about it, and so much is being done in the name of
&quot;preventive diplomacy&quot;, that we thought it was important to address it here in
some way. </p>

<p>The assumption with both conflict prevention and preventive diplomacy is that
intractable conflicts are easier to avoid before they happen, rather than fix once they
have occurred. There is a great deal of truth to this assumption, although some conflicts
are likely to be unavoidable. </p>

<p>A fundamental assumption of constructive confrontation is that the <i>destructive
nature of conflict</i> is largely avoidable. Hence we would advocate an incremental
approach to both conflict prevention and preventive diplomacy. This means that latent
conflicts should not be repressed or submerged altogether. (When this is done, they just
tend to erupt, sometimes quite violently, at a later time.) To avoid this, conflicts
should be allowed to surface, but that the complicating factors, especially escalation,
should be limited to the maximum extent possible, and an effort should made to confront
the core conflict with the most beneficial and least destructive strategies available.
This means trying to put the emphasis on the exchange and integrative strategies, moving
away from force-based strategies--especially illegitimate and excessive force. </p>

<p>The term &quot;preventive diplomacy&quot; is usually used in the international arena
and refers to efforts of outside nations or groups of nations (for example, the UN) to
prevent the escalation of conflicts between or within other nations. Although potentially
effective, often nations feel that they should not intervene in the internal affairs of
others if the situation has not yet become dire. By that time, preventive measures are
likely to be impossible. (This happened in the Bosnian situation, for example). &nbsp;
Nongovernmental organizations can also engage in what is generally referred to as conflict
prevention (since they are not state actors).&nbsp; Given their ongoing presence in much
of the two-thirds world, they are in a far superior position to try to intervene in
developing conflicts early enough to put them on a constructive, rather than destructive
course. Discussions about how this can be done can be found in some of the examples,
below.</p>

<p>Conflict prevention also is useful in smaller-scale conflicts. To the extent that the
parties can control complicating factors from the outset, define the conflict as a mutual
problem rather than a competitive or win-lose situation, and utilize a strategy that
depends most on integrative and exchange approaches more than force, the conflict is
likely to be more productive than destructive. Once escalation sets in and other
complicating factors develop, the strategy must change from conflict prevention to
conflict management or resolution, which is generally considerably harder to accomplish
successfully.</p>
