<p>Communication is fundamental to all social processes--especially conflict.&nbsp; One of
the first steps people can take to make conflicts more constructive is to examine their
own communication strategies to determine whether or not they are communicating their
interests and needs effectively to the other side, and whether they are understanding the
perspective of the other side accurately.&nbsp; Much can be done to improve interpersonal
and/or intergroup understanding simply by improving the nature--and amount--of the
communication between the parties.&nbsp; (Thus, if communication is cut off, it usually
should be re-started, although sometimes this is best done with third party assistance,
rather than alone.)&nbsp; The following list of techniques are all different ways to
remedy communication problems.&nbsp; They can be used singly or in combination, whatever
is necessary, to be assured that all sides are being heard and understood accurately.</p>
