<p align="left">Conflicts emerge from feelings of intense personal frustration and a
belief that things are happening which are simply unfair. Usually the initial motivation
is quite personal--people feel that they, their family, or group is in some way being
injured.&nbsp; If one is to address the injury in a constructive way, however, these vague
feelings of frustration must be translated into clear statements of principle which
explain the issues at stake and why others should support efforts to correct the
situation. </p>

<p align="left">While the parties can undertake this framing process by themselves, they
may be more successful if they first look at the ways in which similar issues have been
framed by other groups--currently or in history. If they find an especially eloquent
statement which describes a problem similar to their own, they can adapt that statement to
their own situation.&nbsp; This may, to some degree, involve a review of the classic
teachings of the major religions. It may also involve a review of the great campaigners
for social justice--for example, Gandhi, King, or Mandela.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of particular
importance are framing strategies which bring together people of different religious and
cultural backgrounds--if those differences are present in the conflict.</p>
