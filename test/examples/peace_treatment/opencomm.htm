<hr>

<p>In conflict situations, lines of communication between people and groups often break
down. People stop talking to each other, they withdraw representatives (such as
ambassadors or observers) that they have in the other's countries, regions, or groups, and
they are much less open about the information they release to the other side. The result
is often frequent misunderstandings, exaggerated and overly hostile stereotypes, distrust
and fear. Opening lines of communication is one very important step to take if one wants
to de-escalate a conflict. Just by re-establishing communication, misunderstandings can be
corrected and avoided, stereotypes can be broken down, and trust can be built over time. </p>

<p>However, communication is often difficult to start. When a conflict is very escalated,
it is often not possible to simply call up a representative of the other side on the phone
and have a &quot;normal&quot; conversation. Usually some kind of structured framework for
initial communication must be developed. </p>

<p>This is often done by a third party intermediary, who often will initiate communication
by carrying messages or ideas back and forth between two sides. Eventually, when certain
agreements about process can be met, then the intermediary may actually get the parties
together for face-to-face communication. This may be very carefully structured and
confined at first. Then, as a certain level of interpersonal trust is developed, the
communication process can be opened up to be freer, and even made routine, so that
communication between parties becomes common, and the assistance of a third party is no
longer needed.</p>
