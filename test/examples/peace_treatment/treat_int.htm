<p>We use the term &quot;integrative power&quot; to refer to the power that holds people
and societies together.&nbsp; It is the bonds--the feelings of commonality, belonging, of
respect-- that people have with others in their own &quot;group.&quot;&nbsp; (By
&quot;group&quot; we mean family, or community, or religion, or workplace, or
ethnicity--any source of identity that helps people feel as if they are part of one group,
which is distinct from another.)&nbsp; Although it is not commonly considered a source of
power, leading conflict theorist Kenneth Boulding argued that integrative power is
potentially the most powerful form of power that there is--more so than exchange and force
(which make up his other two &quot;faces of power&quot; in his book the <a
href="../example/boul7514.htm"><em>Three Faces of Power</em></a>.) As Boulding points out,
even in war-torn societies, there are usually strong bonds between people on the same
side.&nbsp; Without such bonds, the group would disintegrate and continuation of the
conflict through force would become impossible. &nbsp; Hence, even force requires the
integrative system to be effective, in some form, in order to operate.&nbsp; The treatment
options in the following list are all methods that can be used to strengthen relationships
and thus the integrative system, which then can help reduce destructive conflict and
enhance constructive confrontation of core issues.</p>
