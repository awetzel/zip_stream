<hr>

<p>Although all people communicate all the time, most have difficulty communicating
effectively in conflict situations. Practicing communication skills can have a very
beneficial effect on conflict management and resolution processes.</p>

<p>Roger Fisher and William Ury list four skills that can be learned which will improve
communication in conflict situations. The first is active listening. The goal of active
listening, they say, is to understand you opponent as well as you understand yourself. Pay
close attention to what the other side is saying. Ask the opponent to clarify or repeat
anything that is unclear or seems unreasonable (maybe it isn&#146;t, but you are
interpreting it wrong). Attempt to repeat their case, as they have presented it, back to
them. This shows that you are listening (which suggests that you care what they have to
say) and that you understand what they have said. It does not indicate that you agree with
what they said&#150;nor do you have to. You just need to indicate that you do understand
them.</p>

<p>Fisher and Ury&#146;s second rule is to speak directly to your opponent. This is not
considered appropriate in some cultures, but when permitted, it helps to increase
understanding. Avoid being distracted by outside parties or other things going on in the
same room. Focus on what you have to say, and on saying it in a way that your opponent can
understand.</p>

<p>Their third rule is to speak about yourself, not about your opponent. Describe your own
feelings and perceptions, rather than focusing on your opponent&#146;s motives, misdeeds,
or failing. By saying, &quot;I felt let down,&quot; rather than &quot;You broke your
promise,&quot; you will convey the same information. But you will do so in a way that does
not provoke a defensive or hostile reaction from your opponent. (This is often referred to
as using &quot;I-statements&quot; or &quot;I-messages,&quot; rather than &quot;you
messages.&quot; You messages suggest blame, and encourage the recipient to deny
wrong-doing or blame back. I messages simply state a problem, without blaming someone for
it. This makes it easier for the other side to help solve the problem, without having to
admit they were wrong.</p>

<p>Fisher and Ury&#146;s fourth rule is &quot;speak for a purpose.&quot; Too much
communication can be counter-productive, they warn. Before you make a significant
statement, pause and consider what you want to communicate, why you want to communicate
that, and how you can do it in the clearest possible way.</p>

<p>A number of other rules might be added to these. One is to avoid inflammatory language
as much as possible when dealing with people on the other side. Inflammatory language just
increases hostility and defensiveness&#150;it seldom convinces people the speaker is
right. (Actually, it usually does just the opposite.) Although inflammatory remarks can
arouse people&#146;s interest in a conflict and generate support for one&#146;s own side,
that often comes with the cost of general conflict escalation. To the extent that one can
make one&#146;s point effectively without inflammatory statements, the better.</p>

<p>Likewise, all opponents should be treated with respect. It doesn&#146;t help a conflict
situation to treat people disrespectfully&#150;it just makes them angry and less likely to
do what you want. No matter what one thinks of another person, if they are treated with
respect and dignity&#150;even if you think they do not deserve it&#150;communication will
be much more successful, and the conflict will be more easily managed or resolved. This
means that personal attacks and insults should be avoided, as should verbal or nonverbal
clues that one is disdainful of the other side.</p>

  <dd>In this paper Sebok reflects on years of mediating interpersonal disputes. He lists a
    variety of things disputants do and say that tend to block agreement, and things that they
    do or say that contributes to an agreement. While he acknowledges that intractable
    conflicts are more challenging that the typical kinds of disputes he deals with in the
    ombuds office, he suggests that similar kinds of problems can make intractable conflicts
    worse, and similar solutions might make them more constructive.</dd>
