<p><font SIZE="+2">In many cases the parties to intractable conflict are committed to and
honestly believe that they are living in ways which are consistent with their moral
beliefs. Still, it is common for individuals to act in ways which do, by any reasonable
standard, violate their moral principles. In some cases they do so unconsciously by simply
failing to think through the moral implications of their actions. (It is easy to do things
which clearly advance one's interest's without bothering to think about whether or not
they are fair or consistent with one's fundamental values.) There are, unfortunately, also
cases, where greedy people are completely unconcerned about issues of fairness. &nbsp;
These individuals may use false and misleading moral arguments to justify their purely
selfish actions. The strategy which we call &quot;hypocrisy mobilization&quot; works in
the first case, but not in the second. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Hypocrisy is the practice of behaving in ways which clearly violate an
individual's publicly stated moral beliefs.&nbsp; For example, if a person believes that
all people are equal in the eyes of God, then it is hypocritical to treat some people
better than others.&nbsp; Many people find it extremely embarrassing and painful to
publicly acknowledge their own hypocrisy. It undermines their sense of self-worth and the
esteem with which they are held by others. In many cases people change their behavior,
rather than then act in ways which can clearly and publicly be shown to be hypocritical. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">The key to successful hypocrisy mobilization is, therefore, to create a
situation in which an individual or group is confronted with the hypocrisy of their
actions and is given a public choice to make about the future behavior. When successful,
this strategy will mobilize the integrative system and use it to change behavior. Unlike
force, which usually produces unstable change, the change brought about through the moral
argument of hypocrisy mobilization is usually relatively stable.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">One classic example of this strategy is Martin Luther King's campaign
to end segregation in the United States in the 1950s. With public demonstrations and acts
of civil disobedience, he drew attention to the fact that segregation was incompatible
with the United States' claim that it was a nation in which all men (and women) were
created equal.</font></p>

    been able to point this out, and use these perceptions to change behavior on both sides
