<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">In his book, <em>Stable Peace, </em>(written in the late
1970's at the height of the Cold War), Kenneth Boulding argued that peace does not require
the resolution of the many conflicts which divide nations (and communities). Instead, he
argued, peace merely requires the parties to recognize that violent confrontation, and
threats of violent confrontations, are an expensive, dangerous, and ineffective way of
pursuing one's interests. He believed that other strategies involving non-violent force,
political and legal action, exchange, and the integrative system were far superior. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Boulding envisioned a continuum from stable peace to
stable war with unstable peace and unstable war in the middle. Under conditions of stable
war the parties assume that violent confrontation is the principal, if not the only, way
to pursue their interests. By contrast, stable peace is a situation in which the parties
do not seriously consider violent options when deciding how best to pursue their
interests, even though they might be addressing quite serious conflicts. Boulding's stable
peace characterizes the relationships which exists between the developed, industrial
democracies of Western Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim. His cold war goal,
which is now being realized, was to see this region expand to include the countries of the
former Soviet bloc.</font></p>
