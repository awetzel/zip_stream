<p> The differentiation of jobs and positions in a society and the rank ordering of people
by status will inevitably produce conflict groups which bring latent conflict into the
open. People become aware they have interests in common with others like them in position
and status (Dahrendorf 1959). Those interests will center around common grievances and
goals. Group members recognize other groups whose interests will oppose theirs. The
initial stage of group formation may not involve real group-consciousness. But at some
point, leaders will emerge and group formation will become conscious and deliberate.
Members will make decisions about raising group self-awareness, clarification of group
interests and goals, likely allies and enemies, and so forth. At that point, the character
of the struggle will be decided. Group members may then have their best opportunity to
determine the conflict's costs for them. </p>
