<p>The media plays a very important role in most community, public policy, national, and
international conflicts. Depending on the nature and the amount of media coverage, the
situation can be made better or worse. If the media does a good job of presenting the
issues clearly, from both sides' points of view, much can be done to correct
misunderstanding and avoid escalation borne from rumors and fear. Coverage of moderate,
rather than extreme positions is also helpful, as is coverage of attempts to de-escalate
or resolve the conflict. </p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the press fails to understand the important nature of its role in
conflict escalation and inadvertently escalates the conflict by publicizing inflammatory
remarks and stories, giving far more coverage and/or editorial support to one side of a
conflict over another, or focusing on the destructive aspects of the conflict to the
exclusion of the constructive aspects.</p>

<p>Conflict parties and intermediaries can help prevent such occurrences by making the
effort to explain the issues to reporters in as careful and non-biased a way as possible.
They can explain what conflict management processes are in place or are being considered,
who is involved and why, how the process is structured and why, and ask for the
media&#146;s support in giving positive, responsible coverage of these events. <font
size="4">(</font><font size="3">In societies such as the United States, which have freedom
of the press traditions, it is important that efforts to build a more positive
relationship with the media stop short of efforts to control how a particular story is
covered. Such efforts can easily lead to a counterproductive backlash in which the media
concludes that the parties are attempting to manipulate them.) Given their time
constraints, however, reporters usually appreciate fact-finding assistance such as press
releases, issue papers, and names and phone numbers of&nbsp; key people to contact for
more information. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Direct appeals can also be made to the media's sense of social
responsibility. By involving media representatives in efforts to more constructively
address a conflict, the media can be shown ways of enhancing their prestige through public
service efforts designed to help the community better deal with difficult and dangerous
situations.</font></p>

<p>When negotiations are held in private, the press can get very suspicious, and will
sometimes try to develop stories from rumors about the private meetings&#150;rumors which
may or may not be true. To prevent the spreading of false rumors, frequent press releases
that explain what is happening in the negotiations and why can help generate positive
media coverage. If press releases are impossible&#150;as they are with especially
sensitive negotiations that need complete privacy--explaining to the press why such
privacy is needed, and promising a full report at the end can be helpful.</p>
