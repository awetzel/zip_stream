<hr>

<p>Disputes are often part of a long-running conflict. They may appear to be
unique&#150;involving a new issue and new parties--but they are often just new
developments in a long-running string of similar situations. Protracted conflicts
routinely go through cycles of intensity. They will flare up for awhile, being very
visible and often destructive, then they will de-escalate and become less visible or
critical in the parties' estimation, yet they will not be resolved. As a result, a new
triggering event will occur sometime later which will again escalate the conflict, raising
it to its earlier level of intensity, or even higher.</p>

<p>In order to be able to adequately deal with any conflict or dispute, it is necessary to
understand its historical context. Is this really a new situation, unconnected to anything
that has happened in the past? Or is this connected to past events for one or both
parties?</p>

<p>To the extent that it is connected to past events, the parties will likely have strong
emotions that are tied up with that old event. They may distrust the opponents because of
their behavior &quot;last time,&quot; or they may want to retaliate for a prior loss. They
may have stereotypes of the opponent, based on someone who was involved last time, but who
is not involved this time. Or, if the same people are involved, they may expect them to
behave in the same way, even though the situation is now different.</p>

<p>Understanding the historical context does not mean that one is limited by it. On the
contrary, to the extent that one understands that problems are linked to things that
happened in the past, it becomes possible to move beyond those limitations to a new
definition of the current situation. If one is unaware of past associations, however, they
become much more limiting and problematic.</p>

    -- Understanding Forgiveness </strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This article explains how the analysis of people's narratives can help our understanding
    of the process of forgiveness, as well as aid in conflict management and resolution.&nbsp;
    These narratives, which tell a story about the conflict history from each side's point of
    view, show how people feel about themselves, about their opponent, and about the past and
    possible future relationships.</dd>
