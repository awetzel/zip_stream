<p><font SIZE="+2">Public policy conflicts usually focus upon decision-making processes in
which governmental officials or official bodies must choose between several alternative
courses of action.&nbsp; Inevitably, different parties support different options. The
ability of the decision maker(s) to make wise decisions is often dependent upon the
quality of available information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of each
option. Requirements that formal impact studies be conducted provide one mechanism for
providing this information.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">For example, before the United States government can make important
environmental decisions, it requires that an environmental impact statement be prepared.
This statement must first identify available options (including the option of doing
nothing). It must then analyze the positive and negative impacts which are likely to
result from the adoption of each option. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Also required is a public process through which interested parties can
identify errors and omissions in an initial, draft version of the impact statement. These
errors and omissions are then supposed to be corrected in the final version. o. (This, not
surprisingly, can be a contentious process in which there is no consensus about exactly
how the impact statement should be written and what constitutes errors and omissions.)
&nbsp; Thus the process can be slow, and can appear to contribute to conflicts, rather
than resolve them. Implementation of many of the treatments for <a href="factfinding.htm">fact-finding
problems</a> can minimize some of these problems however.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Despite its pitfalls, the impact statement processes is designed to
help assure that decision-making and dispute resolution processes are better informed. The
impact statements do not make recommendations themselves--the final decision is&nbsp; left
to standard political and legal processes.&nbsp; Impact studies simply try to reduce the
uncertainty involved in such decision making processes and make those processes as
well-informed as possible.</font></p>
