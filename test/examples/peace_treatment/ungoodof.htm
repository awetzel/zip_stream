<p>The UN Secretary General uses what is termed his &quot;good offices&quot; (generally
meaning his prestige and the weight of the world community he represents) when he meets
with world leaders, either publicly or privately, in an effort to prevent international
disputes from developing, escalating, or spreading. For example, in 1998 Kofi Annan
negotiated a settlement of the dispute between Iraq and the U.S. over arms inspections in
Iraq. He used the prestige of his office and the threat of UN Security Council action if
no agreement was reached to force Saddam Hussein to allow continuation of UN inspections.
Earlier examples include U Thant's assistance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Javier
Perez de Cuellar's mediation of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. </p>

<p>The Secretary-General may also assign senior staff members to act as his special
representative, performing the same functions. For example, Brian Urquhart represented the
Secretary General's office for many years, proving &quot;good offices&quot; in the Congo,
the Middle East, Cyprus, and Namibia.</p>

<p>In his book on UN peacemaking efforts, Gareth Evans observed that most of the efforts
at providing preventive diplomacy through the Secretary General's good offices were ad-hoc
responses to crises. The choice of personnel, he noted, has been very limited, and
frequently the people involved lacked the necessary resources to back them up. They had to
rely mainly on their own prestige and the weight of public opinion to be successful in
their missions. </p>

<p>When Boutros Boutros-Ghali became Secretary General he tried to set up a more
pro-active system for preventive diplomacy which he described in a document entitled <a
href="http://www.un.org/Docs/SG/agpeace.html"><i>An Agenda for Peace</i></a>.</p>

<p>This plan was well received, yet lack of resources has prevented its full
implementation. Nevertheless, the Secretary General is well-respected and trusted by most
world leaders, and his mediation or conflict prevention efforts are usually taken
seriously. </p>
