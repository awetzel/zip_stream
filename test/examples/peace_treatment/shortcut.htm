<p>This approach to limiting the cost of pursuing conflicts to the <a href="../problem/bitternd.htm">bitter end</a> starts by recognizing the <a href="#EATNA">EATNA</a>
Limit.&nbsp; The EATNA limit suggests that the parties to important, high stakes
intractable disputes are unlikely to voluntarily accept a settlement if they feel that
some force-based alternative is likely to better advance their interests. If they think
that they have such a force-based option, they are likely to use it as a basis for
threatening their opponents and demanding that further concessions be included in any
agreement. </p>

<p>If the other party believes that the threats are credible and that they do not really
have any workable counter threat strategy, then it would be rational for them to make the
concessions and accept the revised agreement and, thereby, at least reduce their
transactions costs. If, on the other hand, the threatened parties believe that they have
realistic counter-threat options, they are likely pursue those options and demand their
own counter-concessions. </p>

<p>If the conflicting parties can both agree on which threats are a realistic and
credible, then they can negotiate a settlement which produces a similar outcome and saves
everyone the transaction costs. In cases where this agreement is absent, the two sides are
likely to pursue their force based options. Unfortunately, these options are often then
fully pursued to their eventual and often quite bitter and destructive conclusion. While
this process usually yields a winner and loser and ultimately settles the dispute, it is
not likely to resolve long-term underlying conflict. The transaction costs of these
bitter-end confrontations (as measured in terms of time, money, and human lives) can
easily outweigh most or all of the benefits of victory. This can be true for the winner as
well as the loser. There is also the risk of a protracted stalemate in which the
destruction continues indefinitely with no clear winner emerging.</p>

<p>Power contest shortcuts provide an alternative approach which pursues force-based
confrontations just long enough for the parties to determine whose threats are really
credible. At that point, the parties can best advance their position by &quot;<a href="negloopb.htm">looping back</a>&quot; to a negotiation process and accepting an
agreement which is similar to the expected force-based outcome.</p>

<p>Shortcuts work best in cases where the balance of forcing power clearly favors one side
over the other. In these cases it is likely that pursuing the issue to the &quot;bitter
end&quot; will produce outcomes which are very similar to those forecast by the
&quot;shortcut.&quot;&nbsp; Also, when pursuing the issue to the &quot;bitter-end&quot; is
likely to result in some type of compromise, shortcuts can be very good at identifying the
point where this compromise&nbsp;will occur. </p>

<p>There are also likely to be cases where different shortcuts predict different outcomes.
For example, different public opinion polls might predict different outcomes for an
election. Constitutional scholars may also have different opinions concerning the Supreme
Court's likely ruling on a precedent-setting case. In these cases, is it may be
appropriate to pursue these issues to the bitter end. This is especially true in cases
where decisions would be made by social institutions created for that purpose (such as
elections or the supreme court).&nbsp; However, this is less appropriate in violent
confrontations where the outcome will not be determined by processes which are widely
regarded as legitimate. Also, it is vastly more costly to pursue violent strategies to the
bitter end.</p>

<h3><strong>Examples</strong></h3>

<p>In the case of a dispute which will likely be litigated, a good lawyer should be able
to give the parties an honest assessment of the merits of their case and the probability
of successful legal action. In the U.S., parties considering an expensive legal battle can
&nbsp; hire a retired judge to hear the cases that both sides plan to present and then
offer his or her opinion of the likely outcome of the litigation process. The parties can
then negotiate a settlement which parallels this opinion and avoids litigation costs.
(This is called &quot;private judging.&quot;)&nbsp; An alternative shortcut is a
&quot;mini-trial&quot; in which a neutral third party, along with decision makers (not
lawyers) representing both sides hear the merits of the case presented briefly, and then
the decision makers try (alone or with the third party's help) to negotiate a settlement.)
This approach, too, is likely to result in a decision very similar to that which would be
obtained through much lengthier and more costly litigation.</p>

<p>The outcome of precedent-setting legal action is likely to be less amenable to a
private judging or mini-trial shortcut because there are no clear precedents to provide
guidance. In these case, consultations with a number of constitutional scholars might be
more likely to provide reliable information about the strength of the contending parties'
cases. It is also true that the setting of new legal precedents is likely to be of
sufficient value to justify the increased cost of litigation.</p>

<p>The outcome of legislative contests can often be forecast through informal polls of
&nbsp; legislators or by paying careful attention to votes which raise similar issues and
mobilize similar coalitions. If water developers are, for example, to suddenly start
losing votes on environmental issues that they used to reliably win, then they might
decide to be more willing to compromise on environmental issues. Public opinion polls and
focus groups (see below) can be used to predict voter response to particular candidates
and ballot measures.</p>

<p>Parties trying to change public attitudes in preparation for election campaigns often
use small but representative groups of people (focus groups) to test responses to their
public information and advertising materials. This allows parties to try several different
approaches and then use those approaches which are found to work best with the electorate.</p>

<p>Parties engaged in public protests and nonviolent demonstrations could carefully model
their efforts around successful historical campaigns which addressed similar issues.
&nbsp; They could&nbsp; then clearly explain their plans to adversaries while also
providing them with accounts of how these techniques have worked in the past.&nbsp; This
might help to convince adversaries that the protests and demonstrations represent a
significant source power, and that they should negotiate with their opponents with this
ultimate power in mind.&nbsp; Another shortcut might involve the preparation of detailed
economic analyses of the likely costs of&nbsp; a prolonged strike for both labor and
management.&nbsp; If it is clear that one side can withstand a strike longer than the
other, it makes sense for the parties to sit down before the strike an negotiate a
settlement that takes this power difference into account.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The visible mobilization of military forces may also be able to convince adversaries
that threats are genuine. (There is, of course, a&nbsp; danger that such displays of force
can&nbsp; escalate out of control.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a name="EATNA">EATNA</a></strong> stands for &quot;expected alternatives to a
negotiated agreement.&quot;&nbsp; If one or more of the parties expect that they have an
alternative to the negotiated agreement which they think is superior, then they can be
expected to take it.) [Scroll back up to the top to resume.]</p>

  <dd>One of the key recommendations made by conference participants was to avoid the rush to
    military intervention, utilizing non-military approaches first.&nbsp; These approaches
    (for example, mediation, political and/or economic sanctions) can be considered, in a
    sense, forcing power short-cuts which have the potential of the same result as force, but
    at much lower cost.</dd>
