<hr>

<p>In highly escalated conflicts the parties may, for all practical purposes, be unable to
control themselves or limit their destructive actions. This is especially true for
violent, all-out confrontations in which the&nbsp; conflict is fueled by the intense
emotions which arise when people experience the tragedy of war.&nbsp; This loss of control
can also occur in escalated and bitter, but still nonviolent confrontations, such as those
which typically occur within political systems which&nbsp; still place <a
href="recog_viol_limits.htm">effective limits on violence.</a></p>

<p>In these cases one option may be some kind of forceful outside intervention which
imposes a moratorium on hostilities while providing the parties with the time that they
need to re-examine their approach to the situation and consider available alternatives. At
the international level,&nbsp; peacekeeping forces can enforce a truce, which gives time
to the diplomats to try to negotiate a peace treaty which will formally end hostilities.
At the national level, police can keep fighting factions apart; even at the interpersonal
level, friends or relatives can intervene in a dispute between two people, first to
physically keep them apart, and then, perhaps to help them work through the underlying
difficulty in a nonviolent way.</p>

<p>External intervention can be either neutral (as it is in all of the above examples), or
partisan.&nbsp; Partisan intervention occurs when an outside party puts pressure on one of
the disputants to act in a particular way.&nbsp; The international sanctions against South
Africa during the Apartheid era, for example, placed pressure on the South African
government to end that system of racial discrimination.&nbsp; Likewise the sanctions
against Iraq were intended to prevent Iraq from developing or storing weapons of mass
destruction.&nbsp; Both of these examples illustrate how external intervention can empower
one group, at the expense of another.</p>

<p>The alternative is neutral intervention, in which an outside party moves in to try to
prevent further violence, and/or to help the parties negotiate a formal end to their
conflict.&nbsp; Peacebuilding--in which the ordinary citizens (as opposed to leaders or
diplomats) try to reconcile their differences and rebuild normal relationships--is another
way in which external intervention can be helpful.</p>

<p>Key to the success of all of these approaches is not simply the suppression of
conflict, but rather the channeling of conflict in more constructive, but still effective,
ways. This requires that all external intervenors adhere to basic principles of fairness
and make a commitment to provide all the parties with a forum through which their
complaints can be meaningfully addressed. </p>
