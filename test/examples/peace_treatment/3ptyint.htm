<p>The terms &quot;third party&quot; and &quot;intermediary&quot; are both used to refer
to a person or team of people who become involved in a conflict to help the disputing
parties manage or resolve it. Third parties might act as consultants, helping one side or
both sides analyze the conflict and plan an effective response. Alternatively, they might
act as facilitators, arranging meetings, setting agendas, and guiding productive
discussions. Facilitators will also usually record what was said, and may write up a short
report summarizing the discussions and any agreements that were reached.</p>

<p>A more active and powerful third party role is that of mediator. Mediators not only
facilitate discussions, but they usually impose a structure and process on the discussions
that is designed to move the parties toward mutual understanding and win-win agreements.
While many different styles of mediation are common, most mediators have the conflicting
parties sit down together to explain to each other their views about the nature of the
problem and how they think it might best be solved. The mediator often tries to get the
disputants to focus on underlying interests (the things they really need or want) more
than their initial opening positions (what they initially say they need or want). By
clarifying the divergent views and reasons for those views, mediators can usually get the
parties to develop a common understanding of the situation, which often yields a solution
which satisfies the interests of all parties. While some mediators take a stronger role in
option identification and selection than others, mediators do not have the power to impose
a solution. At most, they can suggest a solution, which the disputants may or may not
accept.</p>

<p>The most powerful third party role is that of an arbitrator. An arbitrator listens to
presentations made by both sides, examines written materials and other evidence relating
to a case, and then makes a determination of who is right and who is wrong, or how a
conflict should be settled. Usually, the arbitrator&#146;s decision is binding and cannot
be appealed. Thus, the arbitrator is the most powerful type of intermediary. Arbitration
works well when the parties simply want a settlement, and do not worry about losing
control of the process or the outcome. For parties that want to maintain control, however,
the other forms of intervention (mediation or facilitation) are often preferred.</p>
