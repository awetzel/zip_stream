<p align="left">A common problem in many technical and/or scientific disputes is that the
public, and often the decision makers as well are not technical experts and they find it
difficult, if not impossible, to understand the technical information given them by the
experts.&nbsp; The situation can be even further complicated by the fact that both sides
to a conflict will usually be able to find their own experts who will contradict the
experts on the other side.&nbsp; This leaves the public and the decision makers unable to
tell who to believe.</p>

<p align="left">One way to surmount this problem is to ask the experts to present their
data in a simplified way that non-scientists can understand.&nbsp; By using graphs,
charts, photos, demonstrations, even games, much can be done to explain complex concepts
in a way non-technical people can understand.&nbsp; the following three essays give
examples of how this can be done.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong> 

<dl>
  <dt><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="1068 " --><a HREF="../example/appl1068.htm"><strong>John
    Applegate and Douglas Sarno -- Coping with Complex Facts and Multiple Parties in Public
    Disputes</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This article illustrates several innovative ways to make complex information more easily
    understandable to non-scientists.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="7502" --> <strong><a href="../example/sand7502.htm">Peter M. Sandman--Explaining Environmental Risk</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This article explains that the public assesses risk and uncertainty very differently
    from experts.&nbsp; It then suggests ways in which risk can be explained to the public so
    that they can make informed decisions. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="6038 " --><a HREF="../example/fish6038.htm"><strong>Roger
    Fischer, Elizabeth Kopelman and Andrea Schneider -- Consider the Other Side's Choice</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This short essay illustrates a method to assess the consequences of various actions.
    &nbsp; Although it is presented in a very different context, the notion of making a chart
    to compare consequences of different decisions is a good way to simplify a great deal of
    information.</dd>
