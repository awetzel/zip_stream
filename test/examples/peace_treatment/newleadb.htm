<p>When new people enter a negotiation or become leaders of a group involved in an ongoing
conflict, it is important that they be fully briefed about the history of the conflict and
conflict management or resolution processes that have already taken place. Although it is
inevitable that the new people will not see things exactly the same way as the people they
replace, less disruption of the conflict management process will occur if the new people
at least enter the process understanding what is going on and what has gone on before.
That way, they will not insist on doing things that have already been done, ask questions
that infuriate the other side because the answer is &quot;so obvious,&quot; or otherwise
harm relationships or the process itself simply out of ignorance of the past.</p>
