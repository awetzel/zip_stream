  <p><font SIZE="+2">Efforts to improve communication are often limited by the fact that
  good communication takes time. There are many instances in which it would be desirable for
  the parties and constituency groups to engage in lengthy conversations, yet they do not
  &nbsp; have the time to do so. Nor do they have the money to travel the distances they
  need to in order to talk face-to-face as often or as extensively as they would like.</font></p>
  <p><font SIZE="+2">Telecommunication technologies can, in large measure, reduce these
  problems by providing efficient mechanisms of communication which are very quick, easy to
  use, and inexpensive.&nbsp; While they are not face-to-face, and therefore are not as
  personal as a face-to-face conversation, electronic communication is far better than no
  communication at all, which is often the alternative. By encouraging greater
  communication, telecommunication can improve interpersonal and intergroup understanding
  which is likely to&nbsp;&nbsp; increase the constructiveness of the overall conflict.
  Specific areas in which the electronic media can make important contributions include:</font><ul>
    <li><font SIZE="+2">&#149;<strong>Videotapes</strong>. Important speeches and even
      negotiation sessions can be easily and inexpensively videotaped and then shared with
      people who are unable to attend the sessions in person. </font></li>
    <li><font SIZE="+2">&#149;<strong>Radio and television broadcasts</strong>. These broadcasts
      allow very large groups to witness negotiations, public hearings, another important events
      to determine, for themselves whether or not their interests are being accurately included
      in the discussions. (Often, however, negotiations are better conducted privately, with
      media coverage reserved for the end.)</font></li>
    <li><font SIZE="+2">&#149;<strong>Electronic mail and fax machines</strong>. The ability of
      e-mail&nbsp; and fax machines to deliver messages across the planet in a matter of seconds
      makes effective international communication possible. </font></li>
    <li><font SIZE="+2">&#149;<strong>Web sites and Internet search engines. </strong>The
      ability to find Web sites with the Internet search engines such as Excite, AltaVista, or
      Yahoo make it much easier for parties to recruit allies on a national and international
      basis. It also helps advocacy groups get their message out to the general public.</font></li>
    <li><font SIZE="+2">&#149;<strong>Internet-based telephony. </strong>The Internet can also
      be used to transmit at vastly lower cost, conventional telephone calls. </font></li>
    <li><font SIZE="+2">&#149;<strong>On-line training programs. </strong>On-line education and
      training programs (like this one) make it much easier to disseminate information about new
      and more effective ideas for dealing with conflict problems.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font SIZE="+2">These are just a few examples. The potential of these new technologies
  is expanding almost daily, and the global reach of the technology is spreading rapidly as
  well.</font></p>
