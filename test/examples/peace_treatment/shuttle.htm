<p>In very escalated conflicts, increasing communication between the parties directly can
do more harm than good. Often the parties will simply continue the ongoing destructive
debate--repeating their non-negotiable positions and demands over and over again, accusing
the other side of wrong-doing and evil intent, and trying to score &quot;points&quot;
against the opponents or with people on their own side or sitting in the middle. To do
this, an attempt is made to seem better, smarter, more righteous than the other side, and
to make the other side look as bad as possible. &quot;Communication&quot; that does this
seldom makes situations better--it usually makes them worse. For that reason, the
suggestion that one opens up the lines of communication to help resolve a highly conflict
can be very problematic.</p>

<p>One way around this problem is to rely on shuttle diplomacy or mediated communication
at the early stages of an escalated conflict when direct communication is likely to be
counterproductive. If a third party can be found who will carry information back and forth
between parties, a reliable means of communication can be established that is not as prone
to the grandstanding of face-to-face or media-based communication. The intermediary can
relay questions and answers, and can privately suggest ideas (of his own or from one of
the parties) for de-escalating the conflict that could not be made publicly. By keeping
the communication private and indirect, the parties will not feel a need to use the
debating tactics they commonly use in public conversations, and will be able to build up a
level of trust that could not have been developed in those circumstances. Once this trust
and a certain level of mutual understanding is developed, then face-to-face and even
routinized communications can be started.</p>

<p>A well-known successful example of shuttle diplomacy and mediated communication was the
Camp David negotiations between Israel and Egypt, mediated by U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
Carter got Egyptian President Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Begin together at the
beginning of the negotiations and quickly learned that the relationship between the two
men was very hostile and tense. Requiring the two men to negotiate directly would make
settlement very unlikely, Carter concluded. However, he did see the possibility of
progress if he (Carter) would do the negotiating for each side, carrying proposals and
counter-proposals back and forth over the course of the two-week negotiations. Although
the discussions appeared to be stuck several times, through his non-stop shuttle
diplomacy, Carter was eventually able to get Sadat and Begin to agree to a text for
peacemaking between their two nations. </p>

<p>Such shuttle diplomacy and mediated communication can be done on a much less grand
scale. In international conflicts, low-profile mediators such as Quaker or Mennonite peace
workers, members of humanitarian NGOs (nongovernmental organizations), or scholars can
help relay messages back and forth before direct communication is feasible. In
smaller-scale disputes, mediated communication can also be helpful. Even in family
disputes, it is common for a brother to act as an intermediary between another brother and
a parent, or for a trusted family member to act as a go-between for angry husbands and
wives. In any situation where communication is made difficult because of distrust and
anger, mediated communication can provide the impetus to get productive conflict
management started.</p>
