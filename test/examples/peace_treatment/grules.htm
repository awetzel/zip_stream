<p>Ground rules are the rules of conduct for a conflict resolution process, such as
negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or consensus-building. They may cover disputant
behavior, intermediary behavior and role, the process, or the substance of the
discussions. For example, behavioral ground rules for negotiation or mediation may be that
people must talk one at a time, that they must listen carefully to their opponents&#146;
statements, or that they must treat each other with dignity and respect. Ground rules on
the intermediary&#146;s role in mediation or consensus building might include the idea
that the intermediary will set an agenda for each day&#146;s meetings, which needs to be
approved by the parties, and that the intermediary will lead the discussion, giving each
party and equal amount of time to talk. Process ground rules for a mediation might say
that people are expected to be on time for meetings, that substitute representatives must
be approved before the meeting occurs, and that observers are (or are not) allowed.
Finally, substantive ground rules will define which topics are to be covered, and which
not.</p>

<p>When the disputants are familiar with each other, and with the process, such ground
rules may simply be assumed and not stated outright. If the disputants have not worked
together before, however, or are not familiar with the process, explicit ground rules can
be very helpful in focusing the discussions in a productive way and preventing the process
from becoming side-tracked by unnecessary procedural disputes.</p>
