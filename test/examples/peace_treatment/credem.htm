<p>If fact-finding efforts are to be of any value, then the parties must believe them. In
the absence of believable or credible facts, the parties will simply believe what they
want to believe and make uninformed decisions which often fail to achieve the desired
results. To avoid this problem, successful credibility building efforts are essential.
These efforts must do three things. First, fact-finding efforts must be honestly conducted
and produce reliable results which are worthy of the public's trust.They must be done by
competent, qualified experts, who use accepted methods of data collection, analysis, and
interpretation.&nbsp; Second, some mechanism is needed for demonstrating this
trustworthiness to the parties.&nbsp; Although the personal credibility of the experts is
one approach, this can be supplemented with a variety of credibility-building procedures
such as&nbsp; <a HREF="../!treating_overlays.htm#oversite">oversight, </a><a
HREF="../!treating_overlays.htm#jfactf">joint fact-finding, </a>or <a
HREF="../!treating_overlays.htm#datamed">data mediation</a>).&nbsp; Finally, some
mechanism is needed for explaining the information in ways which allow it to be understood
and sensibly used to make wise decisions. </p>

  <dd>This is a description of the aftermath of the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear
    power plant in Pennsylvania (U.S.) Residents' fears about potential risks of cleanup
    activities were high due to distrust of the plant operators and regulators.&nbsp; The
