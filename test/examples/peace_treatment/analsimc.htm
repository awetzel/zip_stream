<p align="left">Learning Form the Experiences of Others </p>

<p align="left">The old adage is true--those who refuse to learn from history's mistakes
are condemned to repeat them.&nbsp; Humans have been engaged in serious and often deadly
conflicts throughout their history. During that time, virtually every type of conflict
&nbsp; (over scarce resources,&nbsp; power, or ideological differences, for example) and
incremental conflict problems (such as misunderstandings, closed lines of communication,
or distrust) has arisen repeatedly. Most of the available strategies for dealing with
these problems have also been&nbsp; repeatedly employed. The result is that we now know a
great deal about what is likely to happen in various situations. This base of experience
can be used to make reasonably accurate forecasts of the probable results of alternative
strategies.&nbsp; Such forecasts can be used to help&nbsp; parties select strategies that
are more likely to achieve their objectives. </p>

<p align="left">The purpose of this website is to give readers some knowledge of conflict
problems and solutions that have been tried before.&nbsp; Many other stories are available
elsewhere--from friends and acquaintances through word of mouth, through popular
literature (even fiction), and through scholarly research.&nbsp; Although time is often a
problem in emerging conflicts, the more time one can spend analyzing what others have done
in similar situations, what has worked effectively, and what has not, the better able one
will be to chose a course of action that will result in the desired outcome.</p>
