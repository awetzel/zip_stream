<p><font SIZE="+2">Soldiers have, traditionally, recognized that the high ground (a hill
or mountain top) provides a significant military advantage. The term &quot;moral high
ground&quot; applies the same principled persuasive (rather than military) power. Parties
seeking the moral high ground simply refuse to act in ways which are not viewed as
legitimate and morally defensible by the larger the society. The most common example is
people who refuse to use violence against an opponent.&nbsp; Nonviolent actors generate an
enormous amount of sympathy among outsiders, as they clearly are not threatening their
opponents (at least not physically).&nbsp; Therefore, any physical force used against them
appears to be highly illegitimate and immoral.&nbsp; In addition to generating outside
sympathy, by taking the moral high ground, disputants can generate a sense of guilt among
their opponents, which will greatly lessen their opponents' effectiveness.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">In addition, parties that take the moral high ground
protect&nbsp;themselves from efforts of their opponents to use moral arguments to mobilize
supporters. The other obvious advantage of pursuing a moral high ground strategy is that
it encourages parties to &quot;do the right thing.&quot;&nbsp; (This assumes, of course,
that the parties are pursuing interests and strategies which are genuinely morally
defensible. If a party acts in an immoral way, while pretending that their actions are
morally justified, the result is likely to be much less successful.</font></p>
