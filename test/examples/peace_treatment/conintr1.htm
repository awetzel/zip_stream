<p>Conflicts of interest arise whenever an individual's private, personal interests
conflict with their other conflict-related responsibilities. A conflict of interest arises
when a supposedly neutral intermediary benefits personally from an agreement or decision
which resolves a dispute in a particular way. In a dispute between labor and management,
for example, a mediator who owns stock in the company would probably benefit from a
pro-management decision. As a result, he or she would be tempted to act in ways which
favor management. Even in cases where the intermediary took their responsibilities
seriously and acted in a professional and impartial manner, there would still be an
appearance of bias which would lead many to conclude that the decision or agreement was
unfair. Conflicts of interest&nbsp; arise with a variety of conflict-related roles
including mediator, arbitrator, judge, legislator, advisor (to one of the parties), and,
even, news reporters.</p>

<p>If not corrected, this problem can substantially reduce public support for efforts to
handle conflicts more constructively. To avoid this problem intermediaries with potential
conflicts of interest are commonly asked to withdraw from the dispute and turn their
responsibilities over to someone who truly has no personal stake in the outcome of the
dispute. In some cases, there may be formal legal requirements which prevent conflict of
interest from arising by providing parties with a mechanism through which they can force
the removal of the biased (or, potentially biased) intermediaries. In other cases there
are voluntary, though still strongly supported, ethical standards are relied upon the
prevent conflicts of interest from arising. </p>

<p>There are also cases in which intermediaries with such a strong reputation for fairness
are accepted by all parties even though they have a personal stake in the outcome. This
form of &quot;<a href="ipmedtn.htm">insider partial</a>&quot; mediation is actually more
common than the outsider neutral model in many parts of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; In these
cases the conflict process tends to shift away from one focused upon neutral
intermediaries and toward one focused upon solid, interest based negotiation between the
parties., facilitated by an intermediary who is well known and trusted by the people on
all sides.</p>
