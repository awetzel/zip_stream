<p>I-messages or I-statements are a way of communicating about a problem to another person
without accusing them of being the cause of the problem. Often, when someone has a problem
with another person, they tell them so by using a &quot;you-statement,&quot; for example,
&quot;you didn't finish the financial report on time!&quot; While that statement may be
true, by phrasing it that way, the listener is likely to get defensive, and begin to
argue. For instance, they might reply, &quot;I couldn't because the deadline was
unreasonable!&quot; or &quot;You are always pestering me. I'd get more done if you'd just
leave me alone!&quot; </p>

<p>Another approach to the same problem is using an &quot;I-message.&quot; For example,
the worker could say, &quot;I really am getting backed up on my work since I don't have
the financial report yet.&quot; The co-worker's response to this statement is likely to be
more conciliatory. For example, she might respond, &quot;I know. I'm sorry. I'll finish it
up today and try harder to meet my deadlines. I had a lot of things piling up at once this
week, but I'll get it to you as quickly as I can.&quot; While this doesn't completely
solve the problem, it retains the good working relationship between the two people, and is
more likely to generate more cooperative interactions in the future than the accusatory,
&quot;you message&quot; approach. </p>

    <dd>The authors describe how &quot;I-statements&quot; reveal one's vulnerability,&nbsp; but
      argue that this can actually lead to an increase in persuasive power, not a decrease as
      one might expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>
