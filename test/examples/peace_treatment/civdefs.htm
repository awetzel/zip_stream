<p>Civilian defense is a strategy for defending against potential military aggression
which uses unarmed civilians, rather than armed forces, to defend against attack. Thus,
rather than relying on military force to deter or repel an invasion, civilian defense uses
nonviolent approaches--primarily massive noncooperation--to make invasion more trouble
than it is worth.&nbsp; By withholding political, social, and economic cooperation from
the invading army and government, the local citizens can make the society come to a stand
still.&nbsp; Political noncooperation, for example, would include civil disobedience, the
boycott of governmental activities (such as voting) and the establishment of alternative
governmental offices.&nbsp; Social noncooperation can include refusing to participate in
social activities, or even acknowledging the presence of the invaders.&nbsp; Economic
noncooperation includes strikes and boycotts of goods and services.&nbsp; Although none of
the acts alone will be successful, if many of these protest tactics are implemented by a
large body of citizens, they can be very difficult to overcome. This will prevent the
invaders from gaining any benefits from their occupation, and may well lead them to
abandon their efforts.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Civilian defense also diminishes the legitimacy of the invading force, which slowly
will reduce its power.&nbsp; As&nbsp; Gene Sharp, and expert in nonviolent direct action
asserts, all governments, no matter how tyrannical, govern only with the consent of the
people.&nbsp; If this consent is withdrawn, the government will fall, as it takes people
to implement its policies.&nbsp; Although it has not been widely utilized, civilian
defense has been used successfully in the past.&nbsp; For example, the Germans used this
approach to resist the Kapp Putsch in 1920, the French used it to oppose a coup in 1961,
and the Norwegians used it to resist Nazi occupation.&nbsp; Most recently, it was used by
Lithuanians and Russian citizens in 1990 when the Lithuanians were fighting for the
independence from the Soviet Union and the Russians prevented the coup against Gorbachev. </p>

<p>Although the use of civilian defense to deter attack is more difficult than to defend
one after it has occurred, some scholars think that its use as a deterrence strategy will
increase as its use increases and its effectiveness becomes better known.</p>
