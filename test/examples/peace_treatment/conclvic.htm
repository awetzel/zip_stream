<p><font SIZE="+2"><strong>Conciliatory Victory</strong></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Conciliatory victory offers a relatively simple strategy for dealing
with the &quot;gloating victor&quot; problem. All it requires is that victorious parties
do what they can to assure defeated parties that they are still valued members of the
community and that they can look forward to a future in which their legitimate interests
will be protected. It is also important to assure losers that they will not be socially
ostracized. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Often those involved in destructive conflicts develop unrealistic and
exaggerated fears regarding the consequences of defeat. Conciliatory actions can do much
to reduce these fears and thereby reduce the likelihood and severity of future disputes. </font></p>
