<p><font SIZE="+2">In order to be successful, societies have had to develop political
institutions capable of limiting internal violence by providing effective alternatives to
violence-based dispute resolution mechanisms and by the development of police and military
institutions capable of preventing citizens and other nations from using violent
strategies to pursue their interests. These political institutions provide nonviolent (or
at least less violent) mechanisms for making broad policy decisions and enacting laws
which govern the way in which the legal or judicial system resolves day-to-day disputes.
These political institutions also specify the exact circumstances under which police and
military can use their monopoly on overwhelming violent force.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Over the centuries, different societies have developed very different
political institutions. Common contemporary political systems include those based upon
religious law, democratic principles, monarchies, and dictatorships.&nbsp; When we refer
to &quot;political power&quot; or &quot;political force,&quot; we are referring to
nonviolent methods for bringing about public policy changes through the political system.
&nbsp; This may involved what, in the U.S., is called &quot;lobbying&quot; the decision
makers--talking with them, writing to them, and otherwise trying to convince them to vote
or decide in your favor using persuasive power and/or the threat of lost votes (in
democracies) if they do not do what the lobbyist wants.&nbsp; Also included in political
power is the power of elections--individual laws can be put up for a vote, as in
initiatives and referenda in the U.S.--or people can be voted into and out of office.
&nbsp; Finally, legislative governing bodies wield political power when the enact laws
which they are enforced by the judicial system under the system of <a

<p><font SIZE="+2">The topic of political power is huge, far beyond the scope of this
website--and even too broad to provide links that deal with it as succinctly as the legal
power links.&nbsp; For our purposes, we simply suggest that parties to conflicts examine
the political power structure existing in their community and nation, and consider if
there are political approaches for dealing nonviolently with the presenting problem.</font></p>
