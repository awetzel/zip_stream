<p>A major contributing factor to escalation and destructive confrontation is destructive
speech. Destructive speech may take several forms, each requiring a somewhat different
treatment strategy. In some cases, it involves the use of provocative and insulting names
to refer to opponents. Many groups have extremely insulting words they use to refer to
opposing groups. These words are often seen as so offensive that they are viewed as what
we call &quot;fighting words,&quot; provocations sufficiently serious to elicit a violent
reaction. . Also destructive is the use of everyday words to condemn others for their evil
views or to make vague threats about how the world would be better off if they were to die
or simply disappear.&nbsp; In the United States, we refer to this as &quot;hate
speech.&quot;&nbsp; There are two principal strategies for controlling this type of
speech. </p>

<p>One strategy is to precisely define hate speech and then enact laws and organizational
policies to severely punish anyone who uses it. For example, in the United States,
universities frequently have speech codes which they use as a basis for expelling students
found to be guilty of hate speech. Some political jurisdictions in the United States have
tried to enact laws prohibiting hate speech as well. These laws empower the police to
investigate alleged incidences of hate speech.&nbsp; Guilty parties are tried and punished
according to the law.</p>

<p>Opponents of this approach raise two principle objections. First, hate speech can be
very hard to precisely define. Statements which some people regard as hateful, &nbsp;
others may regard as an honest effort to raise the tough issues. Hate speech prohibitions
can also be used as a basis for the suppressing dissent and harassing people. It is almost
always possible to accuse people raising difficult issues of hate speech crimes. Even if
they're found to be not guilty, the accusation and the adjudication process can be
extremely costly and painful. Hate speech laws also violate freedom of speech ideals which
so many societies value. They can also have an extremely chilling effect upon efforts to
honestly discuss the tough issues which underlie most conflicts. Often, when hate speech
prohibitions are in place, people engaged in serious intergroup conflicts simply refuse to
talk at all, preventing constructive problem solving and allowing tensions to build.</p>

<p>The principal alternative is a strategy which systematically tries to answer hate
speech with good speech. Here, reasonable people on all sides of the conflict make an
individual and collective commitment to speak out against hateful communication. For
example, if an extremist belonging to a group makes hateful and racist statements, other
members of that group will collectively and publicly repudiate those statements in ways
which demonstrate that they are not supported by the vast majority of the population. In
cases where the extremist's hateful activity results in personal injury or property
damage, members of the group can pool their resources to compensate the victims.</p>

<p>Hateful speech is often not intentional. Frequently, people will say hurtful things
without thinking about what they're saying and how it might be interpreted. There are, for
example, words which have very different meanings for different groups. There are also
translation problems and problems which arise when translators tend to make worse case
assumptions in their translations. It is also common for members of a group to compete
with one another for group approval by trying to make the most clever and most forceful
statements against opponents. In these cases, problems can often be minimized through some
type of sensitivity training which helps the parties 1) identify statements which are
likely to be interpreted in hurtful or hateful ways, 2) understand the consequences of
making such statements, and 3) understand alternate and less destructive ways of raising
the difficult issues. </p>
