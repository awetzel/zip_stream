<p>Truth commissions are a strategy designed for situations in which war crimes and human
rights abuses have largely stopped and societies are struggling to come to terms with the
tragedy. One focus is&nbsp; investigations to determine what actually happened, especially
to people who may have just &quot;disappeared.&quot; There is also the challenge of
determining who was responsible and assigning appropriate punishment. This requires one to
consider the forces that led people to commit such crimes. In the most serious cases the
crimes are attributable to absolutely indefensible behavior by people who knew what they
were doing and had the power to stop it. In other cases, crimes may have been perpetuated
by lower ranking officials who were, in fact, being forced to do what they did by people
in higher authority. Still, other crimes may have resulted from the terrible effects of
violent <a href="../!overlay_problems.htm#escalation">escalation</a> which can lead to the
kind of emotional hysteria which causes people to do things that they would otherwise
consider absolutely unthinkable. This results in a situation in which both sides are
committing atrocities to avenge and retaliate for atrocities committed by the other side.</p>

<p>Reconciliation of past war crimes often presents a difficult dilemma. On the one hand,
victims of these terrible crimes, find it impossible to simply forget about the crimes and
live in a society with the perpetrators as if nothing happened. For them some measure of
justice is likely to be an essential part of the healing process. On the other hand, if
the victims of such crimes insist on holding everyone fully responsible for what might be
quite murderous acts, then the result is likely to be an all out fight to the death rather
than reconciliation and healing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here strategies that combine a search for
truth and justice, linked with <a href="amnesty.htm">amnesty and forgiveness</a> are
likely to be essential. </p>
