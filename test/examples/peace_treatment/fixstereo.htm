<p>Stereotypes are essentially assumptions that are made about a person or group's
character or attributes, based on a general image of what a particular group of people is
like. Just as people assume that all cars have four wheels, while all bicycles have two,
they also assume that all men have certain attributes that differ from women. In reality,
a few vehicles that might be called &quot;cars&quot; have three wheels-as do some
bicycles. So, these stereotypes about cars and bicycles are not always accurate.
Stereotypes about men and women are even less likely to be accurate, as people's
characteristics vary much more so than do vehicles. Some men have physical or
psychological characteristics that are more characteristic of women, while some women may
resemble men in certain ways. So stereotypes are generalizations that are often
oversimplified and wrong.</p>

<p>Stereotypes are especially likely to be wrong in conflict situations. When people are
engaged in a conflict, their image of their opponent tends to become more and more
hostile. As communication gets cut off, people make generalizations and assumptions about
opponents based on very sketchy and often erroneous information. They see faults in
themselves and &quot;project&quot; those faults onto their opponent, preferring to believe
that they are good and their opponents are bad. Eventually, opponents develop a strong
&quot;enemy image,&quot; that assumes that everything the other side does is evil or
wrong, while everything they do themselves is good. Such negative stereotypes make any
sort of conflict resolution or conflict management process more difficult.</p>

<p>A first step toward overcoming these problems is becoming aware of the tendency to hold
negative stereotypes of opponents, and then making a conscious efforts to correct the
inaccuracies. Often this is done by increasing person-to-person contacts between people
from different groups. Usually, when people meet each other, talk together, and/or work
together, they will soon learn that the opponents are not nearly as awful as they had
earlier believed. (Of course, sometimes opponents will confirm the negative images, which
makes overcoming them even harder.) Small group workshops-dialogues, analytical problem
solving workshops, mediation sessions, joint projects, and training programs are all ways
in which stereotypes can begin to be broken down and more accurate images of the opponents
developed. </p>

    Circum-negotiation: Arenas of the Peace Process</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Saunders describes four stages of the peacebuilding process. All involve questioning
    stereotypes and replacing them with more accurate understandings of the opposing group(s).
    This must occur at all levels--from official negotiation to public dialogue to the
    re-establishment of a civil society.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></dd>
