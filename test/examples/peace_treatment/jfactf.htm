<p>Often experts analyzing the probable consequences of resolving disputes in different
ways reach very different and apparently <a href="../problem/conexpt.htm">contradictory
conclusions</a> . These contradictions often lead the public to conclude that scientific
and technical analysis is really no better than the &quot;common sense&quot; assessments
of lay people (i.e. non-experts). In most cases this conclusion is not warranted. &nbsp;
Expert application of the scientific method can yield important information, provided that
the experts understand the role of technical facts in the larger dispute resolution
process. </p>

<p>Here joint fact-finding and data mediation can make an important contribution. These
techniques use <a href="consens.htm">consensus building </a>and <a href="mediatn.htm">mediation</a>
to help the experts resolve their disagreements over the technical facts. In joint
fact-finding, the experts and the constituency groups which they represent develop and
implement a joint strategy for answering the key policy questions, based upon generally
agreed-upon scientific methods. It is commonly understood that the experts do not have to
reach agreement on every issue. Their primary goal is to clearly separate the issues upon
which they can agree from those which are still subject to debate and then report their
findings to the parties. Here it is important for the experts to explain their findings in
ways which non-experts can understand.&nbsp; Points of agreement can then provide the
parties with a more informed basis for resolving the dispute. Points a continuing debate,
however, will require the parties to employ strategies for dealing with <a
href="uncert.htm">uncertainty</a>. The goal is to use areas of technical consensus to
eliminate options which clearly do not advance the parties interest, and then use
strategies for dealing with uncertainty to approach the remaining technical issues. </p>

<p>Data mediation may also identify longer term and more expensive strategies for
resolving outstanding uncertainties. While this can often be very useful, there are
limitations on how much research is appropriate. In many cases, the benefits of better
information are outweighed by costs and delays associated with further fact-finding. There
are also cases in which further fact finding is unlikely to be helpful, no matter how much
time and money is spent. This is because the technical problem may be so difficult that
experts cannot hope to find the answer.</p>

    Foothills Case)</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In this case study, each of the parties initially collected their own data which led to
    a credibility problem. The problem was resolved by having a third party--the U.S. Army
    Corps of&nbsp; Engineers so a fact-finding study that was jointly designed by the parties
    and the core, and carefully monitored by the parties to make sure it was accurately done.</dd>

    Fishing Industries Negotiate: Mediation and Scientific Issues</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>One aspect of this dispute involved a scientific disagreement over the impact of
    underwater geologic acoustic testing on fish.&nbsp; Initially, the oil companies which
    were doing the testing insisted that their experts found no impact, while the fishermen
    said they did.&nbsp; This was resolved with the formation of a joint fact-finding
    committee.</dd>
