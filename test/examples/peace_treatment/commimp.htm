<p><strong>Misunderstanding </strong></p>

<p>Social conflicts always involves some misunderstanding. Conflict parties communicate by
what they say (or do not) and how they behave toward one another. Even normal interaction
involves faulty communication but conflict seems to increase it. The higher the level of
conflict, the more costly misunderstanding may be. During the Cold War, miscommunication
between US and Soviet leaders could be catastrophic in its consequences. At every stage
and level of conflict, clear communication among parties usually works to reduce unwise
decisions by and costs for the participants. </p>

<p><strong>Communication Accuracy </strong></p>

<p>Much determines the accuracy of communication among conflict parties. As a conflict
emerges, adversaries become more emotional. Anger, fear, hostility, and suspicion all
serve to make communicators more likely to send and receive faulty messages from their
opponents, even from their supporters. Emotion control would be one way of encouraging
accuracy. The context of the communication is also important. The more noise and
distraction, the less clear the message. The pace of message exchange would also influence
clarity, for example, how long and carefully one considers a message before responding to
it. How easily one can respond would affect such consideration. A conflict among physics
faculty, for instance, intensified as participants were able to dash off e-mail responses
to one another, unrestrained by slower, more direct and more stressful ways of
communicating. Finally, a verification capability for conflict parties would tend to
increase communication accuracy, checking that messages sent were correctly received. </p>

<p><strong>Sending and Listening Skills</strong> </p>

<p>Conflict parties should use a message checker for written communications, somewhat like
a computer's spellcheck function. A checker is someone who will ask you what you wish to
convey by your intended message and whether it will actually be heard that way by the
recipient. This is often done incidentally but building it formally into the communication
process would give it the prominence it deserves. Much misunderstanding is created simply
by careless and imprecise use of words, the &quot;sounds like but isn't&quot; problem. </p>

<p>The more hostile communication is, the less accurately it may be heard. Hostility
produces a defensive reaction by the receiver, who is then less likely to pick up nuances
that give a message greater clarity. An important sending skill is knowing how to favor
disarming language over arming language. The latter selects more forceful over more
moderate words, uses statements rather than questions and when spoken, is usually
accompanied by hostile intonations, pauses and other nonverbal messages that convey
hostile feeling.</p>

<p>Making points and expressing emotions through &quot;I&quot; messages is a technique
that often works to expand an opponent's ability to listen and hear. Such messages locate
the conflict outside of the listener, where it can more easily be reframed for cooperative
resolution. &quot;I&quot; messages also focus on behavior rather than person as the source
of the conflict. Less likely to be felt as personal attacks, they encourage a similar
&quot;I&quot; response from the &quot;other.&quot;</p>

<p>Often a conflict party is less interested in being clearly understood than in
&quot;having their say.&quot; If their opponent is similarly motivated, a war of words
with little clear communication is probable. However, having one's say is a necessary
first step toward mutual disclosure and emotional openness to resolving the conflict. An
opponent's disarming listening, though, may be as useful as her disarming language. In
fact, how one listens tells the speaker much. The technique of active listening (Hocker
and Wilmot 1991, 239) has several functions. First, the listener permits the venting of
emotion. The speaker feels heard, tension is released. The listener's body posture and
gestures such as head nodding confirm for the speaker the sense of being heard. His
feelings are reflected back by the listener( e.g. &quot;It really was important for you
that....&quot;). She restates or paraphrases what the speaker has said, again checking
with him for accuracy. She then asks clarifying questions for further information. The
telling-listening function is extremely important in conflict resolution. This is
particularly true where a continuing relationship between the parties is necessary,
whether it be divorcing parents or ethnic communities in Bosnia. </p>
