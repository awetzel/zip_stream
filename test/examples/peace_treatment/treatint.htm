<hr>

<p>We use the term &quot;integrative power&quot; to refer to the power that holds people
and societies together.&nbsp; It is the bonds--the feelings of commonality, belonging, of
respect-- that people have with others in their own &quot;group.&quot;&nbsp; (By
&quot;group&quot; we mean family, or community, or religion, or workplace, or
ethnicity--any source of identity that helps people feel as if they are part of one group,
which is distinct from another.)&nbsp; Although it is not commonly considered a source of
power, leading conflict theorist Kenneth Boulding argued that integrative power is
potentially the most powerful form of power that there is--more so than exchange and force
(which make up his other two &quot;faces of power&quot; in his book the <em>Three Faces of
Power</em>.) As Boulding points out, even in war-torn societies, there are usually strong
bonds between people on the same side.&nbsp; Without such bonds, the group would
disintegrate and continuation of the conflict through force would become impossible.
&nbsp; Hence, even force requires the integrative system to be effective, in some form, in
order to operate.&nbsp; The treatment options in the following list are all methods that
can be used to strengthen relationships and thus the integrative system, which then can
help reduce destructive conflict and enhance constructive confrontation of core issues.</p>
