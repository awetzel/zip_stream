<p></font><font size="3">Often negotiations break down because one (or more) of the
parties think that they have an alternative that is better than the one they will obtain
through negotiation. (As Fisher, Ury, and Patton say it, they think they have a better
BATNA--&quot;best alternative to a negotiated agreement.&quot;) Often, however, this BATNA
is more an illusion than reality. Before finalizing an agreement, or breaking off
negotiations, it is wise to test the validity of one&#146;s BATNA. In his book <i>Getting
Past No</i>, Ury suggests pushing one&#146;s opponent to examine his BATNA by asking
questions such as &quot;what will happen if we don&#146;t agree?&quot; Or &quot;what would
you advise me to do, if we don&#146;t reach an agreement?&quot; Or &quot;what will you do
if we don&#146;t agree?&quot; Often these answers reveal flaws in one&#146;s assumptions
about one&#146;s alternatives, making the negotiated settlement look better in comparison
than it had before.</p>

<p>Helping parties assess their BATNAs is one task a mediator often performs.&nbsp; Often
meeting alone (in a caucus) with one side at a time, the mediator will explore each
party's image of their alternative approaches for dealing with their problem.&nbsp; The
mediator will help the party estimate the likely costs and benefits of each approach and
will give an alternative opinion--or suggest the party seek further advise (such as a
lawyer) if their assessment of costs or benefits of a strategy seem unrealistic.</p>

  <dd>Some observers felt that the anti-Iraq coalition had unrealistic expectations regarding
    the potential effectiveness of force.&nbsp; Unstated, but also apparent, Saddam Hussein
    also likely had unrealistic expectations about his chances for success against coalition
    forces.&nbsp; Had either (or both) sides done reality testing, a less destructive outcome
    might have resulted.</dd>
