<p>Often people involved in difficult or intractable conflicts define the problem as a
win-lose situation. They assume that anything that they win will cause the other side to
lose, and vice versa. With integrative reframing, the parties try to redefine the problem
in a win-win way. This can either be done by expanding the resources from which they are
drawing (sometimes referred to as &quot;expanding the pie&quot;) or redefining what they
want so that everyone can have what they want at the same time, even with limited
resources.</p>

<p>Often, integrative reframing involves focusing on interests, rather than positions.
When done in this way, it is the same as interest-based framing. (<a href="intframe.htm">Click
here</a> for a discussion of interest-based framing) But win-win reframing can also be
based on needs, rather than interests. Although fundamental human needs are not
negotiable, they are often mutually reinforcing. For example, if both sides seek more
security, by agreeing not to threaten each other with violence, the need for security can
be met simultaneously by both disputants. The key to integrative reframing in this case is
framing the conflict in terms of needs, and then examining how those needs could be met
for all sides simultaneously. (Click <a href="../!treating_overlays.htm#needfram">here</a>
to see the related discussion of needs-based framing.)</p>
