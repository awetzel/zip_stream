<p>Just as reframing is often best accomplished with the help of an outside third party
(or an insider partial who is acting as a mediator), scoping is also often done with the
assistance of a third party.&nbsp; The third party can usually bring a broader and less
biased view of the situation, and can help the parties see things that they did not see
before.&nbsp; Experienced third parties can also explain how this conflict relates to
others, either on-going or in the past, which helps the parties understand the scope of
their problem.&nbsp; Since framing and scoping are usually done together by mediators,
more information on assisted scoping and framing can be found in the write-up on <strong><a HREF="jtrefram.htm">Joint Reframing/Assisted Reframing</a>.</strong></p>

  <dd>This article describes how insider partial mediators help people in conflict in Central
    America to come to a new, shared understanding about their situation and how to &quot;get
    out&quot; of it.&nbsp; This process involves both framing and scoping.</dd>

  <dd>This is a story about assisted reframing and rescoping.&nbsp; By finding an outside
    person (a Rabbi) to reinterpret their problem, the disputants in this case were able to
    see their situation in a very new perspective, which enabled them to resolve it easily
    when they could not before.</dd>
