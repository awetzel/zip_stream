<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their best-selling book on negotiation, <a
href="../example/fish7513.htm"><i>Getting to Yes</i>,</a> Fisher, Ury, and Patton compare
three kinds of negotiation or bargaining: soft, hard, and principled. Like hard
bargaining, soft bargaining involves the negotiation of positions, rather than interests.
However, to avoid the common problems associated with bargaining over positions, the
negotiators will take a &quot;soft&quot; approach: treating the participants as friends,
seeking agreement at almost any cost, and offering concessions easily in the interests of
preserving (or creating) a good relationship with the other side. Soft bargainers will
trust the other side, and will be open and honest about their bottom line. This leaves
them vulnerable to hard bargainers who will act competitively&#150;offering few, if any
concessions, concealing their bottom line, even making threats. In a negotiation between a
hard bargainer and a soft bargainer, the hard bargainer will almost always emerge with a
substantially better deal. (Yet two hard bargainers competing against each other may end
up both losing&#150;hence the advice to bargain hard in all cases is not wise.) Fisher,
Ury, and Patton suggest that principled negotiation&#150;which negotiates interests rather
than positions is the best alternative to either hard or soft bargaining.</p>

    yielding , and inaction, and the way in which each of these affects the &nbsp;
    negotiation's outcome.&nbsp; Yielding is essentially the same as soft bargaining.</dd>
