<p>Collective security is one type of coalition building strategy in which a group of
nations agree not to attack each other and to defend each other against an attack from one
of the others, if such an attack is made.&nbsp; The principal is that &quot;an attack
against one, is an attack against all.&quot;&nbsp;It differs from &quot;collective
defense&quot; which is a coalition of nations which agree to defend its own group against <em>outside</em>
attacks.&nbsp; Thus NATO and the Warsaw Pact were examples of collective defense, while
the UN is an attempt at collective security.&nbsp; Proponents of collective security say
it is a much more effective approach to security than individual countries trying to act
alone, as weaker countries cannot possibly defend themselves, and countries that try often
become involved in never-ending arms races which actually detract from, rather than
enhance, their security over the long term. In addition, it is argued, collective security
arrangements encourage international cooperation, while balance of power deterrence leads
to competition and conflict instead.&nbsp; Although the UN got bogged down in the
superpower conflict during the cold war, now that that era has ended, many observers
expect and hope that the UN will become a much more effective actor in protecting the
security of its members.</p>

<p>Other scholars and diplomats, however, feel the collective security concept is
misguided.&nbsp; It is seen as conceptually muddled (as it is often confused with other
similar concepts) and naively unrealistic.&nbsp; Although they are pledged to defend each
other, many countries will refuse to do so, if such an act is not in their own best
interests or is thought to be too risky or expensive.&nbsp; In addition, it has been
argued, collective security arrangements will turn small struggles into large ones, and
prevent the use of alternative (nonviolent) problem solving, relying instead on the much
more costly approach of military confrontation.&nbsp; In addition, there is always a
danger, that alliances formed for the purposes of collective security can also service as
a basis for an aggressive coalition. </p>
