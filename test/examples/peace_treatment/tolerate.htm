<p>The principles of coexistence and tolerance are important as bases for building
mutually acceptable relationships between highly diverse communities within a larger
society. If the integrative system is to work--that is, if it is to be able to hold a
diverse community together as a single entity (for example, a nation state)--there must be
a certain level of tolerance between the different religious, ethnic, and/or racial groups
living in that state. In the absence of tolerance and willing co-existence, societies will
be in perpetual conflict, with each side trying to somehow get rid of the other, either by
forcing them to leave (as refugees), through genocide, or by one group completely
dominating and de-humanizing the opposing group(s). </p>

<p>How co-existence is structured can vary widely. Generally, there are two
approaches&#150;one seeking to minimize or ignore differences between groups, and the
other recognizing differences, but honoring each group as valuable and unique. The first
is embodied in the concept of the &quot;melting pot,&quot; an idea developed in the United
States which referred to the fact that many different nationalities and ethnic groups
supposedly &quot;melted together&quot; to become Americans. Until the 1970s or so, the
goal of most minority groups was to become integrated into the dominant white society.
People wanted to be judged, as civil rights leader Martin Luther King put it, &quot;not by
the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.&quot; Thus, the goal for
America was to become &quot;color blind&quot;-- everyone was to be treated the same,
regardless of their race or national origin.</p>

<p>Slowly this goal gave way to another view&#150;that of multiculturalism.
Multiculturalism seeks not to melt all of the races together, but rather to honor and
appreciate each race as distinct and valuable. This has the advantage of not imposing one
culture on another, yet it can result in continued conflict. </p>

<p>Many variations on these two extremes are possible. Nelson Mandela, for example, sought
a &quot;nonracial democracy&quot; in South Africa, which he says &quot;respects diversity
but values unity.&quot; This is something of a middle ground between multiculturalism and
the melting pot approach. </p>

<p>Other accommodations for racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious differences can be
made by granting minority groups limited autonomy (over cultural affairs such as religious
worship, education, and language, for example), but maintaining central authority over
political and economic decisions. Click <a href="../example/lapi3336.htm">here</a> for a
further discussion of different autonomy arrangements.</p>

    made in South Africa.</dd>
