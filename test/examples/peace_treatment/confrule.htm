<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often public policy and international negotiations are most
successful if they are carried out privately.&nbsp; Representatives often feel freer to
brainstorm creative solutions, if they do not have to maintain the accepted policies or
positions for the benefit of public observation.&nbsp; When the public is watching,
negotiators more often will continue to hold firm to their extreme positions in an effort
to prove to their own constituencies how &quot;tough&quot; they are.&nbsp; Thus,
negotiation, mediation, and consensus-building processes are often more successful if the
disputants and any third parties (mediators, for example) agree to keep the details of
their discussions confidential until an agreement is reached.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes when private cases are mediated, the settlement remains
confidential.&nbsp; This is one of the characteristics that many people like about
mediation as it is practiced in the West.&nbsp; People can work out their differences in a
private forum, without ever having to acknowledge those differences or the way in which
they were settled.&nbsp; If the settlement involves a public issue, however, the end
result (and often the highlights of the negotiations leading up to it) must be made
public.</p>
