<p></font><font size="3">Face saving (or saving face) refers to maintaining a good self
image. People who are involved in a conflict and secretly know they are wrong will often
not admit that they are wrong because they don&#146;t want to admit they made a mistake.
They therefore continue the conflict, just to avoid the embarrassment of looking bad.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, it is important to allow one&#146;s opponents to make
concessions gracefully, without having to admit that they made a mistake or backed down.
Often a simple change in wording, or an exchange of concessions will help negotiators
maintain a positive image, even when they are actually giving in very substantially.
Negotiation expert William Ury, (1991, p. 105) recommends that negotiators &quot;go slow
to go fast.&quot; By moving slowly, negotiators can trade minor concessions, and can focus
more on what they have gained than on what they have lost. Superior power is useless,
cautions Ury, &quot;if it drives your opponent into a corner and makes him resist you with
all his might. Leaving him a way out is a time-honored precept.&quot; </p>

<p>One aspect of this principle is the rule of not gloating or bragging when one has won a
victory. Gloating makes the other side look bad and feel badly, which can encourage them
to withdraw their cooperation with any previous agreements. </font></p>

  <dd>Fisher, Ury, and Patton have developed a technique for negotiating agreements called
    principled negotiations.&nbsp; One aspect of this approach is to deal effectively with
    people problems and one way to do that, they say, is to allow one's opponent to save face.
    &nbsp; This and other approaches are discussed in this article.</dd>
