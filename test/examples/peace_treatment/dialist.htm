<p>Dialogic listening is an alternative to active listening which was developed by John
Stewart and Milt Thomas. Dialogic listening has four distinctive characteristics. &nbsp;
First, it emphasizes conversation as a shared activity.&nbsp; It encourages people to
attend to their own views--and the other person's views--at the same time, while active
listening focuses primarily on the other person's views alone.&nbsp; Second, it takes an
open-ended--the authors even say &quot;playful&quot;--attitude toward conversation. &nbsp;
It demands modesty, humility, trust, and recognition of the opponent as a
choice-maker.&nbsp; Third, the parties focus on what is happening between them, not what
is going on in the mind of one or the other person.&nbsp; And fourth, dialogic listening
focuses on the present, rather than on the future or on the past.&nbsp; In this way,
parties can work together to frame the nature of their problem, can come to a new
understanding about each other, their relationships, and the options before them. &nbsp;
While the same outcomes can occur by using active listening, dialogic listening is more of
a joint process, and thus is more likely, the authors argue, to yield a shared
understanding of the problem, and potentially a shared solution.</p>
