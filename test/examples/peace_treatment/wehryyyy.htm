<h1 align="center">Third Party Intervention</h1>

<p><strong>Intermediary Roles and Functions </strong></p>

<p>When impartial third parties intervene in a conflict situation, new relational
structures and possibilities for moderating the conflict are created. Introduction of a
mediator, for example, changes both the physical and social structure of a conflict. New
groups and sets of transactions appear with the third party. The presence of an observer
tends to put contenders on better if not their best behavior. More accurate communication
is facilitated by intermediaries. The issues, interests and needs of the contenders become
more clear with the help of such third parties. There may even be someone besides one's
adversary to blame, as intermediaries sometimes divert blame toward themselves as a
technique for transforming stalemate into resolution. Most importantly, third parties
bring additional minds and skills for problem-solving to the conflict. The contenders are
no longer on their own. </p>

<p><strong>Multi-modal Intermediation </strong></p>

<p>Many types of third parties can be introduced in a conflict, simultaneously working
together, or at different points in a conflict when their form of assistance is most
needed. Lederach (1997, 70) identifies nearly 25 different functions intermediaries
perform over the life of a conflict. Intervention could begin with the
&quot;explorer,&quot; who assures the contenders that total victory is not the goal of the
other side and end with the work of the &quot;reconciler,&quot; who facilitates the
healing process. Along the path of resolution, &quot;unifiers&quot;,
&quot;facilitators,&quot; &quot;legitimators&quot; and many other specialist roles are
introduced. Such a multi-modal approach is necessary with large-scale conflict such as
civil war. An intervention team must use particular skills and relationships with the
contenders at the right time, in the right context. Even intraorganizational and
two-person conflict could benefit from the team approach, though the types of intervenors
would be smaller. &quot;Who is there who could help us out of this conflict?&quot; This
should be the first question conflict opponents should ask. The more varied their concept
of &quot;third party,&quot; the more intermediary potential they will see as they look
around. </p>

<p>An important function of third parties in a conflict, particularly in its latent stage,
is conflict prevention. At the international level, multinational peacekeeping has for
almost forty years been a common way of preventing conflict and violence. Military forces
and observers are placed between opposing sides; interposition is the term. As Yugoslavia
was coming apart in the early 1990s, a new variant of peacekeeping was tried; preventive
deployment. (Carnegie 1997, 64) Macedonia, intending to become an independent state, was
threatened with attack from Serbia. A United Nations military and political contingent was
sent to Macedonia as a deterrent. It has also played an intermediary role between the
Macedonian and Serbian governments. </p>

<p>&nbsp;A preventive presence of third parties is not necessarily a military or
governmental one. Private citizen groups have increasingly intervened to prevent violence
in conflict situations. (Wehr 1996) Citizen interposition was practiced in the Nicaraguan
civil war in the 1980s. International teams from Witness for Peace were stationed along
Nicaragua's borders and in strategic villages at high risk from Contra attack.
(Griffin-Nolan 1991) The assumption underlying such a practice is that the presence of
unarmed foreigners deters attacks on civilians in war zones. The same principle motivates
international accompaniment, where foreign observers stay with human rights leaders whose
protest work puts them at risk in civil conflicts. (Mahony &amp; Eguren 1997) </p>

<p><strong>Illustration 1:&nbsp; Bosnia</strong></p>

<p> The multiplicity of intermediary roles and functions has been illustrated in numerous
contemporary international conflicts. Efforts to end civil war in Bosnia suggest many of
them: European Community involvement as intermediaries and mediators through various
failed plans; United Nations humanitarian peacekeeping...modest military, medical and
supply forces to protect major urban centers; NATO military interposition to implement the
Dayton Agreement and support political reconstruction; citizen reconciliation teams from
nongovernmental organizations.. In the Nicaraguan civil war, intermediation was done in a
number of ways. (Wehr and Lederach 1991) Within the Esquipulas process, the presidents of
the Central American nations created conciliation commissions for each of the civil wars
in progress. Oscar Arias, president of Costa Rica, played the lead intermediary role,
since his nation was historically neutral and unarmed since 1948. His persuasive
intervention got the Sandinista government and its opponents to agree to demilitarization
of the conflict and meaningful elections. </p>

<p><strong>Illustration 2:&nbsp; Nicaragua</strong></p>

<p>A second conflict, between the Sandinistas and Atlantic Coast indigenous groups,
complicated Nicaraguan peacemaking. Intermediary types essential in that process included
insider-partial mediators such as Cardinal Obando y Bravo and outsider-neutral mediators
such as Jimmy Carter. International observer teams monitored the elections and the
subsequent transfer of power. Reconciliation teams have now been working nearly a decade
to reintegrate demobilized soldiers from both sides into their towns and villages. </p>
