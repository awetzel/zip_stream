<hr>

<p>Religion is a very strong integrative factor for most people, although it can be
divisive as well when different religious groups oppose each other. Nevertheless, churches
can be a strong influence in moderating or resolving conflict. They tend to place a high
value on human life and peace; many also emphasize the importance of forgiveness and
reconciliation of differences. </p>

<p>A few religions--the Quakers and the Mennonites, for example--have a strong tradition
of peacebuilding around the globe. But many other churches and religious groups have
become involved in peace and justice issues as well. The Moravian Church in Nicaragua, for
example, actively pursued peacemaking between the East Coast Miskito Indians and the
Sandinista government during the Nicaraguan war. As is evident in the examples below,
religious leaders have been active peacemakers and peacebuilders in many other parts of
the world as well. Often they are considered more trustworthy than political figures
because they do not have a conflict of interest as many political leaders do.&nbsp; Given
the extent of their influence, churches can be a very effective integrative and
peacemaking force, when they decide to do so.</p>
