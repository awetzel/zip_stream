  <p>Majority rule processes do not require consensus for group action. Instead, decisions
  are made by voting with a majority determining the position of the entire group. This
  approach has the advantage of being able to produce a prompt and clear decision. (In may
  take some time before consensus processes can reach a decisions--if they can at all.)
  Unfortunately, majority rule processes provide only limited incentives for the parties to
  compromise or to find a way for dealing with&nbsp; issues that serve the interests of all
  participants. Instead, the incentive is to compromise only enough to build a majority
  coalition. Once a winning coalition has been achieved, the parties are largely free to
  ignore the interests of other participants. This effect can be limited somewhat by rules
  which require super-majorities (60%, 2/3 or 3/4 for important decisions). Even with
  super-majorities, however, the tendency of majority rule processes is to divide society
  into two competing coalitions (often referred to as the right and left, or liberals and
  conservatives). One key to controlling what is sometimes called the &quot;tyranny of the
  majority&quot; are norms and rules which prevent the majority from disregarding the basic
  rights of the minority. These rights, as they are applied in a political context in the
  United States for example, include but are not limited to the following: <ul>
    <li>Individual Freedom -- people should be allowed to do what they want unless their actions
      hurt others,</li>
    <li>Equal Protection -- the laws should be applied equally to all members of society</li>
    <li>Voting Rights -- all members of the society have the right to vote,</li>
    <li>Freedom of Speech -- all members of the group have the right contribute whenever ideas
      they want the public debate,</li>
    <li>Individual property -- individual property cannot be taken for group used public use
      without just compensation,</li>
    <li>Due Process -- fair processes are used to resolve disputes concerning these rights.</li>
  </ul>

    <dd>The authors observe that conflicts may be either destructive or productive. They
      describe the nature of conflict generally, and then examine those features which make
      conflicts productive or destructive. Majority rule votes, they observe, can lead to
      destructive outcomes as they enforce a win-lose approach to conflict.</dd>
