<h1 ALIGN="center">Crisis Communication Mechanisms </h1>

<hr>

<p align="left">In a crisis, communication mechanisms are more important than ever, yet
without precrisis planning, crisis communication tends to get worse, or even non-existent.
By planning for potential crisis situations ahead of time, however, communication channels
can be already in place, ready to be used when needed.&nbsp; The best-known example of
such communication mechanisms, are perhaps &quot;hotlines.&quot;&nbsp; These are direct
phone lines between opposing leaders--for example there has been one for some time between
the President of the U.S. and the Soviet (or now Russian) leaders.&nbsp; This line was
note used for routine conversations, but was ready on a moment's notice if a crisis
occurred (such as the Cuban Missile Crisis).</p>

<p align="left">Other approaches to crisis communication involve standing fact-finding or <a
href="rumorct.htm">rumor control teams</a> which try to prevent unfounded rumors from
spreading and unnecessarily escalating already tense situations.&nbsp; Also important are
protocols for increasing, rather than decreasing communication with opponents during a
crisis.&nbsp; If opponents meet before a crisis develops and work out contingency plans,
so that each knows how to respond if a crisis appears imminent, steps can be taken to
de-escalate the crisis in planned ways.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">They key factor in all of these approaches is that crises increase the
need for rapid, accurate information. Thus frequent, accurate, and effective communication
both within one's own group as well as with the opposition becomes critically important.
&nbsp; Some ways of achieving this goal are discussed in the examples, below.</p>

  <dd>Ury wrote this book to encourage U.S. citizens to pressure the President and Congress to
    set up additional crisis control measures--beyond the hotline--to try to prevent nuclear
    war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.&nbsp; Even though the Cold War is over, the
    suggestions Ury made are still highly appropriate for other tense international
    relationships.</dd>

  <dd>One of the advantages of the current rapid communication technologies is that it enables
    people to exchange information much faster and more accurately in times of crisis. &nbsp;
    (This, however, can be a detriment as well, as people have less time to &quot;cool
    down&quot; between hostile exchanges.)</dd>
