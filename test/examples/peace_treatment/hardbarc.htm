<p>]In their best-selling book on negotiation, <a href="../example/fish7513.htm"><i>Getting
to Yes</i>,</a> Fisher, Ury, and Patton compare three kinds of negotiation or bargaining:
soft, hard, and principled. Hard bargaining involves the negotiation of positions, rather
than interests. It is highly competitive, seeing victory as the number one goal. &nbsp;
Hard bargainers, according to Fisher, Ury, and Patton, see the participants as
adversaries, and demand concessions as a condition of the relationship.&nbsp; They
distrust the other side and play sneaky games to try to gain the negotiating advantage.
&nbsp; For example they will hold firm to their opening position, refusing to make
concessions, they may mislead the opponent about their bottom line and demand one-sided
gains as the price of an agreement.&nbsp; They will apply tricks and pressure in an effort
to win what they see as a contest of will.&nbsp; Hard bargaining, as described by Fisher,
Ury, and Patton is very similar to what is called &quot;<a href="distbarg.htm">distributive
bargaining</a>&quot; by other theorists--although there are enough differences to warrant
a different essay on that topic.</p>

<p>When confronted with a softer opponent, hard bargaining almost always will win. &nbsp;
When confronted with another hard bargainer, however, it can result in no agreement, or an
agreement which leaves potential mutual benefits &quot;on the table.&quot;&nbsp; (In other
words, such benefits are not discovered or obtained.)&nbsp; ) Fisher, Ury, and Patton
suggest that <a href="pricneg.htm">principled negotiation</a>&#150;which negotiates
interests rather than positions is the best alternative to either hard or soft bargaining.</p>

  <dd>Pruitt discusses four basic negotiation strategies--problem solving, contending,
    yielding , and inaction, and the way in which each of these affects the &nbsp;
    negotiation's outcome.&nbsp; Contending is essentially the same as hard bargaining.</dd>
