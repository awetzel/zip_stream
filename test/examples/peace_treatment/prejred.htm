<p>The term &quot;prejudice&quot; refers to stereotypes which lead&nbsp; parties to view
their opponents as threatening adversaries who are inherently inferior or are actively
pursuing immoral objectives. Such prejudices lead the parties to view others as enemies
who must be actively opposed. This results in a persistent level of destructive tension
which can easily escalate into a highly destructive, all-out confrontation. </p>

<p>Prejudice reduction refers to a collection of techniques designed to break down these
destructive stereotypes. Most often prejudice reduction programs take place on a small
scale--in workshops, for example, which bring together people from different groups to
help them develop a better mutual understanding.&nbsp; At times,&nbsp; efforts are made to
reduce prejudice among the general population.&nbsp; This can be done with widespread
media efforts and/or public education programs, often implemented during the grade school
years.</p>

<p>In both small scale and large scale efforts, a first step which is critical to the
success of these programs is an ability to overcome the many <a href="../problem/commprob.htm">communications problems</a> cited elsewhere in this
training program. This is because a great deal of prejudice arises from simple
misunderstandings and the tendency to make worse case assumptions in the absence of
reliable information. At the workshop level, facilitators can help people explore their
stereotypes, and learn to communicate with each other in a more open, trusting, and
receptive way.&nbsp; At the community or societal level, misunderstandings can be
addressed through carefully crafted public media campaigns and/or education programs
designed to counter common stereotypes and present all groups in their best possible
light.</p>

<p>Still, correcting poor communication may is not usually enough to overcome prejudice.
Better communication may simply prove that the parties do, in fact, hold each other in
mutual contempt, or that they are, indeed, trying to undermine each others interests.
Often such hostility is the result of escalation processes which transform relatively
minor provocations into intense confrontations. For this reason <a href="escalation.htm">strategies
for limiting escalation</a> are also an essential component of effective prejudice
reduction.&nbsp; This also can be attempted in workshop settings or at the larger,
community level.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>The final key to prejudice reduction is the willingness of the parties to tolerate
their differences, especially with regard to moral issues. This is where the <a href="intopts.htm">integrative system</a>'s search for <a href="commony.htm">common values</a>
which transcend differing values becomes critical.&nbsp; </p>

<p>All of these elements ultimately need to be combined into a coordinated process which
will enable the parties to understand how prejudices are undermining their own interests
and how prejudice reduction can be accomplished. </p>

<p>It is also important to recognize that there are likely to be some individuals who can
be expected to resist any prejudice reduction efforts. While these individuals are likely
to present continuing problems, the ability to reduce prejudices among other members of a
group is still likely to yield important benefits. </p>
