<p>One of the first things a mediator usually does is to get each of the parties to
explain to the other and to the mediator what the problem is, from their own point of
view. This allows each side to see how the other side or sides describes or
&quot;frames&quot; the conflict. When there is a big difference in the parties' views
about what is going on, or what the key issues are, the mediator will often try to get the
parties to redefine the nature of the problem together. If they can work together to
develop a new definition of the problem, it is usually much easier to then go on to work
together to develop a mutually acceptable solution to the problem.</p>

<p>This process of joint reframing can take place quickly, or it can develop slowly over
time. Usually, at the beginning of a dispute, parties have a rather vague sense of the
nature of the problem. They know they are angry, they know they have been (or may in the
future) be treated in a way they do not like, but they may not have identified exactly
what the problem is or why it is happening. As discussions between the parties go on,
their understanding of the underlying causes of the situation usually becomes more
apparent. Chris Moore, an internationally-known mediator and mediation trainer, points out
that parties become receptive to reframing, just as they become receptive to the idea of
negotiating at all. (We often refer to a conflict being &quot;ripe&quot; for
resolution&#150;Moore says conflicts become &quot;ripe&quot; for reframing as well.) </p>

<p>Although parties can engage in reframing on their own, it is often very helpful to have
a third party (mediator or facilitator) assist in this process. One of the mediator's main
jobs is to restate things the party has said in a way that causes less resistance or
hostility. For example, while disputants often open their description of a problem in
terms of blame, the mediator will restate the problem is less personal, and less
accusatory terms. Rather than saying &quot;YOU did not uphold the agreement&quot; (thereby
blaming the other party and making him or her likely to respond defensively), the mediator
will restate the problem in more neutral terms: &quot;HE was not paid on time, and he
needs the money to be able to fulfill HIS other obligations.&quot; The underlying truth
(that one side didn't pay the other) is the same, but the way the mediator frames the
problem, sounds more acceptable to the other side.</p>

<p>Mediators also try to reframe situations that are described in win-lose terms, as
possible win-win situations. Rather than assuming that it is impossible for both sides to
get what they want or need, the mediator will probe underlying interests and needs to try
to get the parties to reframe the problem in a way that each sides' needs can be met
simultaneously. </p>

<p>Mediators vary in the degree of direction they give the parties in doing this: some
will just ask probing questions, letting the parties work most of the issues out
themselves; others will be much more directive, suggesting new ways of defining the
problem that the parties themselves might not have recognized, and trying to divert
attention away from issues that really do appear to be unresolvable. In his acclaimed
textbook on mediation, Moore counsels mediators to reframe issues that cannot be
negotiated (such as value conflicts) into interests that can be traded. Another approach,
he says, is to identify larger, superordinate goals that will override the importance of
the value differences. Or thirdly, Moore suggests, mediators can &quot;avoid identifying
or responding&quot; to values issues directly. &quot;Because it is difficult to mediate
guilt or innocence, right or wrong, respect or lack of respect, and so on, the mediator
may want to avoid these questions entirely and focus only on the dispute's components that
can be turned toward interest-based bargaining. If enough issues can be resolved with
interest-based bargaining, the importance of value differences may fade and will be
dropped from a list of demands or topics for discussion.&quot; (Moore, 1996, 221-2)</p>
