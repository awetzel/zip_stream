<p>Stereotype breaking actions are actions that one party can take to prove to their
opponents that they are better in character than the opponent assumes. For example, one
party may visit the opponent personally, and be more reasonable, more friendly, more
agreeable, or more helpful than the opponent expected. When this happens, they are likely
to revise their enemy image at least a little bit, concluding that some members of the
opposition are reasonable people, or even that the opponents, in general, are more
reasonable than they thought they were. Anwar Sadat's first trip to Jerusalem was a
stereotype-breaking action. No one in Israel thought he would come at all, and when he
did, he was much more reasonable, and much more personable than most Israelis expected.
The same was true of Mikhail Gorbachev's first visit to the United States. Gorbachev was
very warm and friendly toward the American people, and they were very much captivated by
him. This effectively broke down many people's stereotypes of Russians as hostile, cold,
and aggressive, and replaced those images with an image much more friendly and open.</p>

<p>In addition to making trips to the opposing country or group, other stereotype breaking
actions are possible as well. One must simply determine what the other side thinks of you
or expects of you, and then do the opposite. If you are expected to be closed to new
ideas, express and interest in listening to new approaches to the problem. If you are
expected to be selfish and aggressive, take a nonassertive stance and make a small
concession that demonstrates good will and a willingness to cooperate with the other side.
The goal is simply to contradict the negative images that people usually have of their
opponents, and begin to replace these negative images with more positive ones.</p>
