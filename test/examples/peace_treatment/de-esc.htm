<p>De-escalation is the reduction in the intensity of a conflict.&nbsp; Sometimes this
occurs quickly, when a conflict escalates rapidly to the point where the parties fear that
further escalation will be catastrophic, and they back off.&nbsp; (This occurred in the
Cuban Missile Crisis between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. which escalated, and then
de-escalated rapidly, since both sides feared further escalation would cause nuclear war.)
&nbsp; More often, however, de-escalation does not occur until the parties have reached a
prolonged &quot;hurting stalemate&quot;--a term developed by Saadia Touval and William
Zartman to refer to a situation in which neither side can prevail, but both sides are
being harmed by continuing the confrontation.&nbsp; Once both sides realize this is the
case, they are much more likely to be willing to negotiate at least a temporary settlement
of the conflict.&nbsp; But as long as at least one side thinks it can win, de-escalation
is harder to achieve.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Unlike escalation, which often occurs rapidly and unintentionally, de-escalation tends
to be slow and only happens intentionally through much effort.&nbsp; A variety of
approaches are possible:&nbsp; the gradual reciprocal reduction in tension approach
(GRIT), cooling off periods, media management, changing communication strategies and
patterns, and others.&nbsp; More details are given below in the individual de-escalation
write ups.</p>
