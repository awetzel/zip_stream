<p>Active listening is a way of listening and responding to another person that improves
mutual understanding. Often when people talk to each other, they don<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t listen attentively. They are often distracted, half
listening, half thinking about something else. When people are engaged in a conflict, they
are often busy formulating a response to what is being said. They assume that they have
heard what their opponent is saying many times before, so rather than paying attention,
they focus on how they can respond to win the argument.</p>

<p>Active listening is a structured form of listening and responding that focuses the
attention on the speaker. The listener must take care to attend to the speaker fully, and
then repeats, in the listener<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s own words, what
he or she thinks the speaker has said. The listener does not have to agree with the
speaker--he or she must simply state what they think the speaker said. This enables the
speaker to find out whether the listener really understood. If the listener did not, the
speaker can explain some more. </p>

<p>Often, the listener is encouraged to interpret the speaker<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s words in terms of feelings. Thus, instead of just
repeating what happened, the active listener might add <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>I
gather that you felt <i>angry</i> or <i>frustrated</i> or <i>confused</i> when<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>. . .[a particular event happened]. Then the speaker
can go beyond confirming that the listener understood what happened, but can indicate that
he or she also understood the speaker<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s
psychological response to it. </p>

<p>Active listening has several benefits. First, it forces people to listen attentively to
others. Second, it avoids misunderstandings, as people have to confirm that they do really
understand what another person has said. Third, it tends to open people up, to get them to
say more. When people are in conflict, they often contradict each other, denying the
opponent<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s description of a situation. This
tends to make people defensive, and they will either lash out, or withdraw and say nothing
more. However, if they feel that their opponent is really attuned to their concerns and
wants to listen, they are likely to explain in detail what they feel and why. If both
parties to a conflict do this, the chances of being able to develop a solution to their
mutual problem becomes much greater.</p>
