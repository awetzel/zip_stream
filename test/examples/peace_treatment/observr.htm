<p align="left">One form of external intervention are international observers who can
observe elections and/or provide protective accompaniment for&nbsp; people who are likely
victims of human rights abuses.&nbsp; Often human rights violations can be limited, just
by focusing international attention on the problem.&nbsp; If likely targets are
accompanied by people from other countries who will witness and report on any threats or
attacks that occur, the attacker is likely to refrain from such actions.&nbsp; While they
may simply turn to another target, if enough observers are present in the community and/or
nation, it becomes difficult to hide from outside scrutiny and condemnation if&nbsp; human
rights abuses continue to occur.&nbsp; More information about how this works is given in
the examples below.</p>
