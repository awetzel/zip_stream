<p><font SIZE="+2">Escalation can be limited by focusing on the future more than on the
past. There is nothing that anyone can do to change the past. Hurtful and destructive acts
will, forever, be part of history. However, there is a great deal that the parties can do
the change the future. If they choose to do so, the parties to serious conflicts can calm
down and collectively imagine the kind of relationship that they would like to have in the
future. They can then develop a plan to build that relationship. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Many of the techniques offered in this training program are much more
effective when they are primarily used to build a more desirable future relationship.
Approaches to conflict which focus primarily upon assigning guilt and punishment for past
misdeeds are much less likely to build a positive future. Instead, they tend to replay the
most destructive parts of the confrontation over and over again in a way which continually
reinforces past hatreds and animosities. Focusing on the future is the only way to start a
new (and better) relationship.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Still, the past must be addressed and &quot;put to rest&quot; or be
closed in some way.&nbsp; It is, after all, the source of the conflict. One of the biggest
dilemmas regarding the ending of past wars is whether the victors should forgive their
opponents and grant amnesty for their &quot;crimes,&quot; or whether opponents should be
criminally prosecuted.&nbsp; Both approaches has their benefits and their costs--yet the
goal of each is to put the past in the past, to enable all sides to move ahead to a more
positive and constructive future relationship.</font></p>
