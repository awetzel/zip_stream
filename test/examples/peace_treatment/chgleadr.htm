<p>Once a conflict has been &quot;personalized&quot;--in other words, once the problem has
been defined, at least in part, in terms of the personalities of the leaders or
negotiators, de-escalation can often by encouraged by changing who these people are.
Sometimes this happens automatically--a government will have an election and a new leader
is selected.&nbsp; This person may be able to make progress in de-escalating a conflict
just by being new--by not being identified as resistant or unreasonable as his or her
predecessor was.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Alternatively, negotiators or group leaders may be changed without a vote.&nbsp; If one
person is seen to be ineffective because they have become too angry with the other side
(or the other side is too angry with them to be able to negotiate effectively), changing
spokespeople and/or negotiators can be very helpful in getting negotiations moving again.
&nbsp; By bringing in new people--who are not viewed as negatively as their
predecessors--opportunities may become apparent that were invisible before.&nbsp; In
addition, fresh people may not be as firmly set in their ways of thinking as people who
have been involved in a conflict for a long time.&nbsp; They may be able to get out of the
&quot;ruts&quot;--the old ways of thinking that earlier negotiators had been stuck in--and
develop new approaches to problems that were not thought of before.&nbsp; They may also be
able to develop more effective personal relationships with their opponents than the people
who came before.</p>
