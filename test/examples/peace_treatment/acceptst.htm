<hr>

<p>Many potential conflicts never really develop, because the one or more of the people or
groups involved decides that the situation is not serious enough to confront the other
side.&nbsp; If one side believes that they have been wronged, or that they are not getting
what they deserve or need, they can either chose to address the problem, or to let it go
without confrontation.&nbsp; Alternatively, they may try to remedy the situation
themselves by getting what they need another way, or forgiving the wrong that has been
done.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This often occurs among low power groups when they do not feel they have the resources
available to confront the opponent.&nbsp; In some cases, they may not even define the
situation as a problem&nbsp; because they have come to define the situation in much the
same way that the high-power group does--as if the status differential is appropriate,
just, or normal (when an outside observer might say it is not).</p>

<p>Acceptance can also occur among high power groups, when they feel that the damage they
could do to the situation or the relationship is greater than the potential pay-off is
worth.&nbsp; This is seen, for example, in many family conflicts, when one person
withdraws from the conflict and accepts a less desirable outcome because they don't want
to harm the relationship with the other family member(s).&nbsp; This can happen even at
the highest levels of international relations, when countries back down from a
confrontation, rather than risking war.</p>

  <dd>This is a description of the Central American approach to conflict resolution.&nbsp; One
    of the first steps typically taken is asking whether the conflict is really worth
    confronting, or if acceptance is a better option.</dd>
