<p>As is clear from the section on <a href="../problem/batna.htm">exchange-based
strategies and the EATNA limit,</a> parties are unlikely to accept a voluntary settlement
resolving a dispute if they think that they can better advance their interests through
some type of force-based strategy. This means that a pre-condition for successful
negotiation is often agreement among the parties about the likely outcome of any
force-based confrontation. It also means that negotiations are likely to break down in
cases where the parties think that they can better advance their interests through some
type of force-based option. In these cases, it is necessary to allow the parties to pursue
their force-based option until the likely outcome is clear to all parties. </p>

<p>However, force does not need to be pursued to the &quot;bitter end.&quot;&nbsp; Rather,
it is usually possible to apply a small amount of force to illustrate one's potential and
willingness to use that strategy, and then return to the bargaining table to see if the
other party or parties has changed its image of the value of negotiation.&nbsp; If it has
not, then a bit more force can be applied, and negotiation can be tried again.&nbsp; This
is what Ury, Brett, and Goldberg refer to &quot;negotiation loop-backs&quot;--the process
of going back to negotiation after one has pursued a power contest, rather than playing
the power contest out until the absolute end when one party is completely destroyed ( and
the other may be badly hurt).&nbsp; Often it makes sense to use power short-cuts, rather
than the most forceful strategy in this situation, as it limits the damage and costs to
both sides, but is often equally as effective (or more so, if costs of the victory are
factored in).</p>

  <dd>Wehr argues that this is the approach Gandhi used in his Satyagraha campaigns, although
    the obviously had not read Ury's book, nor did he likely think about his strategy
    precisely in this way.&nbsp; He did, however, firmly believe that some &quot;truth&quot;
    could be found on all sides, so that force had to be combined with negotiation.</dd>
