<p>The backlash effect can be limited and losing parties can be more successfully <a
href="reloser.htm">re-integrated</a> into society if steps are taken which make it is
easier for the parties to accept defeat. In the United States we call this &quot;face
saving.&quot; The idea is to allow leaders of the losing parties to present the outcome to
their constituents in ways which demonstrate that they are still good leaders. (There are,
of course, cases in which leaders have behaved so poorly that they should be replaced and
face saving efforts are inappropriate.) While much face saving can be achieved by simply
moderating the way in which victors present the outcome, even more progress can be made
when winning party is also willing to make meaningful concessions as gestures of goodwill.
Face-saving also requires that the winning party resist the temptation to brag about their
great victory and ridicule their opponents. By helping the convince losers the defeat is
not as bad as they initially that it would be, face saving efforts can also reduce
pressures to pursue the dispute to the <a href="../problem/bitternd.htm">bitter end</a>
&nbsp;or re-open the conflict at the next available opportunity.</p>

<p>For example, in a labor contract negotiation, if management is in a much stronger
position than labor, they could try to force the labor negotiators to given in entirely.
&nbsp; But, no matter how little power they have, labor is unlikely to completely given in
because it would look so bad to the workers, who might reject the negotiated agreement.
&nbsp; But if management gives in a little and gives labor a bit of what they wanted, then
the labor negotiators can focus on those concessions, therefore &quot;saving face&quot;
for themselves and for labor in general.&nbsp; This makes it much more likely that the
negotiated agreement will be approved.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In extreme cases the parties might even keep unpopular provisions of an agreement
secret. For example, the United States agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey
as part of the agreement which ended the Cuban missile crisis. This face-saving
arrangement was not widely reported in the United States media where citizens thought that
the outcome was far more one-sided than it really was.&nbsp; </p>

<p>There is, however, also a danger that face saving efforts will be carried to the point
where both sides think that they have won. This can give the parties very different and
contradictory expectations regarding the nature of future interactions. This, in turn, can
increase the likelihood and severity of future disputes.</p>
