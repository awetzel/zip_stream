<p><em>David Lax and James Sebenius, &quot;The Power of Alternatives or the Limits to
Negotiation,&quot; in Negotiation Theory and Practice, eds. J. William Breslin and Jeffery
Z. Rubin, (Cambridge: The Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, 1991), pp. 97-114.</em></p>

<p>Lax and Sebenius argue that parties' alternatives to a negotiated agreement play a
large role in shaping negotiations. They note that much negotiation literature focuses on
tactics used within negotiations to optimize a party's outcome. These approaches tend to
treat the range of possible negotiated outcomes as fixed, and focus on helping parties to
achieve the best settlement from within that fixed range. The authors argue that the range
of possible negotiated settlements is shaped by the various alternatives to negotiation
available to the parties. Changes in the parties' alternatives to negotiation may have a
greater effect on the outcome than tactics used within negotiations.</p>

<p>The basic test of any negotiated agreement is whether it produces a better outcome than
both parties' alternative to a negotiated outcome. For instance, if one party is content
with the status quo, potential settlements would have to promise some added benefit before
that party would agree to negotiate. A party which is assured of a swift win in the court
system will choose a litigated win over a negotiated compromise. </p>

<p>Many negotiation theories assume that the parties' alternatives to negotiation are
fixed before negotiations start and do not change. The authors point out that alternatives
can change during the course of negotiations. New information, changes in the overall
situation, renewed attempts to cultivate alternatives, and the culmination of ongoing
processes can all change alternatives, and so change the range of possible acceptable
settlements within negotiations. For instance, an unfavorable ruling in a similar court
case may radically change a party's alternatives to negotiation, and make a negotiated
compromise suddenly seem like an acceptable outcome. The very act of opening negotiations
may affect the parties' alternatives. In arms control disputes, for instance, once
negotiations have begun the best alternative to a negotiated settlement is to continue to
negotiate. Ending negotiations without some agreement leaves the parties worse off than if
they were before attempting negotiations. Sebenius and Lax suggest that &quot;resources
such as effort, time, or money should go toward affecting alternatives or generating new
ones until the expected improvement in the value of the negotiated outcome from expending
additional resources just equals the cost of doing so.&quot;[p. 98]</p>

<p>The authors urge negotiators to recognize the impact of alternatives to agreement. To
this end they further explore the effects of alternatives on negotiations, offer three
general prescriptions for the negotiator. First, negotiators should take time to evaluate
their alternatives to negotiation and, when possible, to take steps to improve those
alternatives. When the possible negotiated outcomes are inferior to the alternatives, the
parties may reasonably decide not to negotiate or to break off negotiations. While such
evaluation and enhancement of alternatives may lead to &quot;failed&quot; negotiations,
they may also produce superior outcomes for one or even both parties.</p>

<p>Second, negotiators should be aware that people tend to overestimate the attractiveness
of their alternatives and the likelihood and degree of their success. Negotiators must be
careful to counteract these biases. Unrealistic perceptions can be deflated by seeking the
perspective of an uninterested third party. Direct exposure to the other side's
perspective can moderate inflated expectations. Mini-trials are also a useful technique.
Negotiations may be blocked when both parties have inconsistent and overly optimistic
assessments of their alternatives. In such cases the parties' biased perceptions must be
moderated in order to make the dispute &quot;ripe&quot; for negotiation.</p>

<p>Third, the authors note that &quot;the ability to affect alternatives and perceptions
of them lies at the root of many conceptions of bargaining power.'&quot;[p. 105] Thus
negotiators who seek to increase their bargaining power should focus on their
alternatives. Lax and Sebenius describe how various types of bargaining power can be
explained in terms of the parties' alternatives. The more intense a party's preference is
the less power they are thought to have in negotiations. Tactical skills are also thought
to be a source of bargaining power. However, both of these types of &quot;power&quot;
operate only within a given range of possible negotiated outcomes. Since the range of
possible negotiated outcomes is set by the available alternatives, these types of power
are unimportant in comparison to the power to affect alternatives. Making irrevocable
commitments increases bargaining power. The authors however argue that a commitment
&quot;functions by restricting the bargaining range in a way that favors the committing
party.&quot;[p. 107]</p>

<p>Making credible threats increases bargaining power by worsening the other party's
alternatives to a negotiated agreement. Dependent parties have less bargaining power
because they generally have fewer alternatives to dealing with the superior power than the
superior power has in dealing with them. </p>

<p>Available alternatives also affect whether parties continue to adhere to an agreement
after it is made. For example, &quot;an insecure contract is an agreement in which one
party's incentives to abide by the terms are reduced after the other party has made an
irrevocable first move in accord with the agreement.&quot;[p. 109] Often, parties'
alternatives to continuing to adhere to an agreement will change in predictable ways over
the course of that agreement. A well designed agreement should try to anticipate these
alternatives, and should be structured to make the agreement the superior option at each
later stage of its implementation. </p>

<p>Controlling alternatives is also a key to influencing the content and outcomes of
decentralized bargaining systems. Sports leagues illustrate this. When the players' union
and the league allow free agency, i.e. players may bargain for employment with any team,
the players have more alternatives. They can always cut a better deal with another team.
Free agency leads to higher player salaries. When reserve clauses are allowed, i.e.
players are bound to negotiate with only one team, the players have fewer alternatives.
Either they reach an agreement with this team or they leave the sport. Reserve clauses
tend to keep salaries low. </p>
