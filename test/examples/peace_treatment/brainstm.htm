<p>Brainstorming is a technique which can be used by a group of people to generate new and
innovative ideas. It is typically used in mediation or consensus-building to develop ideas
for win-win solutions that have not yet been identified. A facilitator or mediator usually
initiates brainstorming by asking the parties to suggest ideas for solving a particular
problem. The only rules for brainstorming are that parties feel free to suggest anything,
and that judgement about the merits of the suggestions are withheld until later. The
facilitator usually lists the ideas on a blackboard or sheets of newsprint, which are
visible to all the participants. This enables participants to keep track of what has been
said, and to build on earlier suggestions. The benefit of brainstorming is that it
encourages broader thinking that might otherwise occur, and often results in creative
solutions to problems that no one person or one side would have been likely to develop on
their own.</p>
