<p>Literally thousands of local, national, and international organizations have been
formed to defend human and civil rights of people around the world.&nbsp; These
&quot;NGOs&quot;--nongovernmental organizations--primarily rely on the power of the
integrative system and persuasion to try to prevent human rights abuses, and to try to do
what they can to mitigate their effects after they have occurred.&nbsp; For instance,
&nbsp; they try to publicize human rights abuses so that the international community will
pressure the perpetrators to stop their behavior.&nbsp; They encourage massive
letter-writing campaigns, the imposition of boycotts and/or sanctions against
perpetrators, and other forms of nonviolent action to try to discourage further abuse from
occurring.&nbsp; Other civil rights organizations engage in protective
accompaniment--providing neutral observers to accompany people at risk of abuse during
their high risk activities--or all the time--to protect them from killing, kidnapping, or
other violence. </p>

<p>The broader worldwide movement to establish&nbsp; universal principles of&nbsp; human
rights and fairness is part of a large scale collective security effort. While agreement
on many of these principles remains extremely elusive, the progress that has been made has
done much to advance the cause of justice and peace.</p>

<p>Other NGOs provide humanitarian assistance to people in need--for instance, they
provide food, clothing, housing, and medical care for refugees who have fled war zones, or
for people in countries plagued by famine or disaster.&nbsp; Sometimes humanitarian NGOs
get involved in peacebuilding efforts as well, although it is important that the goals and
strategies of the organizations remain clear, and that relief workers know what they are
doing and what the effects of their actions are likely to be.&nbsp; When their goals are
unclear, or they try to work in areas in which they do not have expertise, they can
actually cause more harm than good, contributing to the continuation of human rights
abuses or a war, for example, instead of helping to end it.</p>

    humanitarian relief, monitoring of human rights abuses, providing early warning of
    potentially violent conflicts, and conflict resolution. While NGOs can be effective in all
    four of these areas, Aall warns that each of the four activities must be kept separate to
    be effective.</dd>
