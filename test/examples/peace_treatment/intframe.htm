<hr>

<p>Rather than describing a conflict in terms of positions (I want one thing, but he wants
something else, or we both want something that only one of us can have), it is often
helpful to redefine or &quot;reframe&quot; the conflict in terms of interests. Interests
are the underlying reasons why people (or governments or groups) hold the positions that
they do.&nbsp; (Some scholars make a further distinction between interests and
needs--where needs too are underlying desires, but are more fundamental and less tangible
than interests-see needs-based framing.)</p>

<p>As described in the essay on<a href="../problem/intpos-p.htm"> confusing interests and
positions</a>, if the children arguing over the orange had reframed the problem from
opposing positions to underlying interests, they would have seen that there was no
conflict at all. One child could have had the whole orange, while the other could have had
the entire rind. In intractable conflicts, situations are seldom that simple. But making
an effort to redefine or reframe conflicts in terms of underlying interests often makes
some aspects of the conflict simpler to resolve and reveals areas of commonality that can
lead to intergroup cooperation and improved relationships. </p>

<p>For example, a minority group might take the position that it wants complete
independence from its current home country, while the reason that it wants independence
may not actually be independence for its own sake, but rather a desire for increased
political control and an improved social and economic status. If those
&quot;interests&quot; can be provided without independence, then a mutually agreeable
solution might be found. Similarly, a group of neighbors might oppose the construction of
a chemical factory near their homes, because they have fears about safety, noise, and
traffic. If additional safety measures and careful site design can help minimize those
fears, while providing the additional incentive of new jobs, an agreement might be
reached. </p>

<p>(Further examples of the benefits of interest-based framing are attached.)</p>

<p>In U.S. best-selling book, <em>Getting to Yes</em>, Roger Fisher and William Ury assert
that almost all conflicts have negotiable interests. By focusing on underlying interests
rather than overt positions, apparently resolution-resistant conflicts often become
solvable. </p>

<p>Other theorists however, challenge Fisher and Ury's assertion that interest-based
bargaining can solve almost any problems. Many problems, critics say, are distributive in
nature. There really is one orange, or one piece of land, or a certain amount of money
that has to be divided between two or more people or groups. The more one gets, the less
the others get--there is no way around it, no way to &quot;enlarge the pie.&quot; In this
case, interest-based bargaining does not work to generate win-win solutions. Exposing
one's true interests may actually be counter productive, as hard bargainers who hold
positions in excess of their real needs may end up with more. </p>

<p>Interest-based bargaining also does not work when the issues in contention are
non-negotiable--when they involve fundamental values or human needs. In these cases
attempts to use interest-based negotiation may fail, and may even make the conflict more
entrenched and difficult to resolve than it had been before. Thus, human needs theorists
argue, interest-based bargaining is excellent for interest-based disputes, but it should
not be applied to disputes involving human needs or deep-rooted value differences.</p>
