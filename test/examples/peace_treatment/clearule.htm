<p>Processes are much more likely to be successful if all participants have clear and
consistent expectations concerning the structure of the process and its purpose. (Here we
are using the term &quot;process&quot; to refer to the way in which efforts to deal with a
particular dispute are organized.) In some cases the process will be largely determined by
the structure of legal and political institutions. For example elections, legislative
votes, and criminal or civil trials all require the parties to follow&nbsp; precisely
defined procedural rules. In cases where a dispute is being approached through negotiation
and consensus building, however, the parties have a great deal of freedom to choose how
they want to structure the process.&nbsp; Once procedural decisions are made, they should
be followed or renegotiated--not just ignored. If promises are made regarding who will
participate, what issues will be discussed, how personal attacks will be avoided, how the
costs of participating will be supported, when meetings will be held, these need to be
followed.&nbsp; If the process does not meet expectations, participants may decide to drop
out, fearing the process will work against their interests.</p>

<p>It is also important that process organizers not make promises which they cannot keep
and that parties have an accurate image of what a decision making process can and cannot
do. If the parties expect the process to do something that it is not intended to do, then
disappointment is inevitable. If different parties have significantly different
expectations, some level of disappointment is very likely to occur. It is, of course,
appropriate for organizers to state their hopes for the process with the clear
understanding that they will only be achievable if participants do their part.&nbsp; In
general, it makes sense to establish preliminary expectations as a basis for recruiting
participants and organizing the first few meetings. At this point participants can develop
all future procedures. Here it may be useful for a facilitator to provide examples of
processes which have been successfully used to address similar issues in other places or
in the past. </p>
