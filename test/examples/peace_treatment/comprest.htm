<p>Compensation and restitution are payments made to victims of conflict which are
intended either to remedy the current situation or compensate for past losses (for
instance loss of life) which cannot be remedied.&nbsp; These payments may or may not be
monetary.&nbsp; In the United States, we have tried to compensate Blacks and other
minority groups for past discrimination (and even slavery) by instituting programs such as
affirmative action, which give preferential treatment to minority group members in college
acceptance and hiring decisions.&nbsp; In South Africa and elsewhere, land restitution is
intended to compensate people whose land was confiscated during the Apartheid era. &nbsp;
Other forms of compensation or restitution include returning property that was confiscated
or stolen, or acknowledging wrong-doing and the victim's suffering through commemorative
events. Although restitution usually cannot completely undo the damage done in a violent
or protracted conflict, it does serve as a formal apology--an admission that what was done
was wrong--and it helps to make the lives of the survivors better, allowing for some
degree of normalization and potentially reconciliation to take place.</p>

<p>Compensation can also help prevent conflicts.&nbsp; One common form of environmental
conflict is what, in the U.S., are called NIMBY conflicts--for &quot;not in my
backyard.&quot;&nbsp; NIMBY conflicts develop when a new facility is proposed and people
don't want it located near where they live.&nbsp; It might be a hazardous waste landfill,
or a prison, or a factory, or a power plant.&nbsp; People tend to oppose the location of
such facilities nearby, where it will potentially emit hazardous materials, add noise and
traffic, or otherwise pose a degradation of the neighborhood.&nbsp; By offering to
compensate the neighbors for any harm that occurs, NIMBY conflicts can sometimes be
avoided or resolved relatively quickly, while, without the promise of compensation, they
often drag on for years.</p>

    &quot;The Logic Behind the Magic of Mediation&quot;</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Davis recounts an example of mediation &quot;magic&quot;. She describes the community
    mediation of a case involving the burglary and vandalism of a woman's home by a group of
    neighborhood youths. Within mediation the woman was able to express her loss. The youths
    came to understand the harm they had done. They apologized and agreed to make restitution.
    In addition, the oldest youth shared his prior prison experience with the younger children
    and urged them to avoid his mistakes. Davis identifies the elements of mediation which
    help such &quot;magical&quot; events to occur.</dd>
