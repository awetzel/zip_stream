<hr>

<p>The term &quot;civil society&quot; generally is used to refer to social relations and
organizations outside the state or governmental control.&nbsp; Sometimes it is also taken
to mean outside the economic or business sphere as well.&nbsp; Usually &quot;civil
society&quot; refers to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and associations that people
belong to for social and political reasons: churches and church groups, community groups,
youth groups, service organizations, interest groups, and academic institutions and
organizations, for example.&nbsp; It also refers to the activities of these organizations.
&nbsp; </p>

<p>Though independent of the governmental structure, these organizations frequently become
involved in political activities. They try to influence governmental decision making and
participate in a variety of public participation processes.&nbsp; As such, the
establishment and maintenance of a healthy civil society is extremely important for the
successful development and operation of democratic political systems.</p>

<p>During times of crisis created by war, the structures of civil society often
disintegrate or are forcefully closed.&nbsp; The same thing happens when authoritarian or
autocratic governments see civil institutions as a threat and close them down.&nbsp; This
greatly weakens the integrative system, and leads to social relations based largely on
fear and force.&nbsp; Key to overcoming such a society is the re-establishment of a
multitude of social and political NGOs, which give people a voice in the affairs of their
life, give them a sense of belonging and integration with other countrymen and women, and
connect them with their democratic system in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Once civil society has been eliminated, its recovery is very slow.&nbsp; It can be
aided significantly by outside assistance--by international NGOs coming in and helping the
local people start parallel organizations of their own.&nbsp; Training fledgling
organizations in organizational and advocacy skills can be helpful, as can training in
goal setting, option analysis, and conflict resolution.&nbsp; Yet it is important that
organizations be able to form in their own way to meet their own needs--they should not
simply be little models of outside organizations that work in different places and
different cultures.</p>

<p>Although civil society exists independently of the state, it is dependent on the
state's acceptance to be able to grow and flourish.&nbsp; People must have the freedom to
associate, to speak freely, to publish, and to participate in social and political
processes without fearing repercussions.&nbsp; Without such freedom, civil society will be
stunted at best.</p>
