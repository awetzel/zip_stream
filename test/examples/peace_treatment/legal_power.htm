<hr>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Political institutions deal primarily with broad policy questions. They
are not intended to deal with the large number of disputes which inevitably arise over the
implementation of broad political policies and, especially, the enforcement of laws
enacted by the political process. For dealing with these day-to-day conflicts, virtually
all societies have enacted establish some type of legal or judicial system whose judgments
are backed up by the power of the police. In addition to the enforcement of political
decisions, the legal system also provides a mechanism for resolving the many civil
disputes which arise between individual citizens.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Different societies organize their legal institutions in very different
ways. For example, legal systems in current use include those based upon English Common
Law, religious law, or traditional approaches in which community elders are responsible
for arranging just settlements.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">In most societies, extensive legal institutions have developed which
employ substantial resources and large numbers of skilled people who receive extensive
training in professional schools. While further discussion of legal systems is beyond the
scope of this training program, we do include the following links to Web accessible
resources on the subject.</font></p>
