<p>Although democratic decision making processes are better than autocratic or dictatorial
processes, they still tend to favor vested interests in many cases. This occurs because
people who are most concerned about a decision tend to be those who are most involved, and
who are willing to spend the time and money necessary to influence the decision making
procedure. For example, industries which are affected by government regulations spend a
great deal of time and money trying to influence Congressional decision makers, hoping
that those congressmen will enact a bill which is consistent with industry interests.
Often this will involve reductions of regulations on the industry-reductions of pollution
regulations, employment regulations, or export regulations. Individual citizens may be
opposed to such changes--especially to the changes regarding pollution or employment
matters--but the issue is not nearly as important to them as it is to the industry, nor do
they have the time or the money to become involved in every decision which affects them.
So they do not speak out, and the vested interests prevails in the decision making
process. </p>
