<p>When one or more parties to a conflict prefers the status quo (that is, they want no
change to be made), it can be to their benefit to create a decision making process that is
very slow. Or, if they are not in charge of the process design, they can delay their
involvement in the process, thereby slowing down the process, as much as possible. <font
size="3">Delaying strategies are often used by parties that do not have the power to win
the political, legal or other power contests which are being used to resolve the immediate
dispute. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">For example, if a city government is being asked to approve a new
facility--</font>a dam, an industrial plant, a hospital, a new housing development--people
who do not want the facility to be built can sometimes delay the decision making process
so long that the group proposing the project moves elsewhere--before any decision is made
on the merits of the proposal.&nbsp; Thus, by simply delaying the decision making process,
groups who lack power in other ways can still win. <font size="3">Parties whose proposals
are blocked by delaying strategies often give up or move the project to a more hospitable
or less politically-astute location. This helps explains why chemical plants, oil
refineries, and other undesirable facilities are often located in poorer neighborhoods.
&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Delaying strategies can also give the delaying parties time to expand
their power base so that they can increase their chances of winning once a final decision
is rendered.&nbsp; Military units, for example, will often use delaying tactics to allow
their forces to regroup into better offensive or defensive positions. Delays can also give
citizen groups a chance to mobilize additional support. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Tactical delays can also be used by political leaders and other decision
makers who are being asked to make difficult decisions which are certain to make enemies
and jeopardize their opportunities for future advancement. Such difficult issues might,
for example, include the institution of painful economic reforms, staff cuts caused by
unavoidable funding or budget cuts, the institution of expensive, but needed,
environmental protections, or the need to find a location for an unwanted but still needed
facility like an airport, highway, or factory.. By instituting a lengthy and seemingly
fair decision making or consensus building process, these leaders can&nbsp; avoid making a
decision completely, leaving their successors with the unpopular decisions. In the United
States we call this the NIMTO &quot;not in my term of office&quot; problem.&nbsp; </font>The
&quot;delay-default syndrome,&quot; as we have sometimes called this problem, also occurs
when officials are uncomfortable making any decision without having certain technical
information, but that technical information is unavailable. People get the impression that
if they keep studying a problem, they are not making any decisions. That is not true. They
are making a decision to pursue the default, business-as-usual alternative. </p>

<p>In the United States, for example, we can not decide where or how to dispose of
high-level nuclear waste, so we have undertaken study after study on the issue. We have
even studied how to write warning signs to warn people that some really dangerous stuff is
buried 2,000 feet underground. Further, these warning signs have to be written in a way so
that they can be read by somebody who has no knowledge of any currently known language. In
an attempt to be safe, we are spending a lot of time worrying about what the desert
Southwest in the U.S. is going to be like when a great climate change transforms it into a
lush wetland. Meanwhile, we are making a default decision to leave the high-level waste
sitting around urban centers, in questionable storage tanks that may, in fact, be leaking.
</p>

<p><font size="3">Common delaying tactics include 1) insistence upon a lengthy process of
public review, including extensive hearings and publications of draft and final decisions
with lengthy opportunities for public comment; 2) legal action which is structured to be
as time-consuming as possible with actions filed at the last possible moment and all
possible delays and appeals requested. </font></p>

  <dd>Rubin argues in this article that the concept of &quot;ripeness&quot;-- that sometimes
    disputes are ready for negotiation and other times they are not--can be used as an excuse
    not to negotiate or act to resolve a conflict if the party thinks that continuing the
    conflict will work in their favor. </dd>
