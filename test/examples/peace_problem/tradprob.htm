<p>Kenneth Boulding argued that power had <a href="../example/boul7514.htm">three
&quot;faces</a>&quot; or forms--threat, exchange, and what he called love. (We call the
third form of power the power of the integrative system.)&nbsp; Exchange power is the
power you get through cooperation--by giving something to another person or group, they
will give something back to you. &nbsp; Negotiation is one way of implementing exchange,
though exchange often happens in a much less formal way as well.&nbsp; Many problems occur
in conflict situations, however, that prevent cooperation or trade from taking
place.&nbsp; One of the biggest problems is the parties' unwillingness to negotiate.&nbsp;
Often the issues involved in intractable conflicts are considered non-negotiable.&nbsp;
They may involve people's identity, their fundamental rights, or their deep-rooted values
or beliefs.&nbsp; These are the kinds of things people will not trade, and they may not
consider negotiating any other aspect of their conflict either.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Another common problem is the presence of alternatives.&nbsp; If one or more parties to
an intractable conflict thinks they have a way of winning that does not require them
giving up as much as they would have to give up in negotiation, they are likely to pursue
that option instead.&nbsp; In practical terms, this usually means that if one side thinks
it can get its way through force, it is likely to attempt to do so, rather than
negotiating. &nbsp; Only after it becomes apparent that force will not work, or that the
costs of using force are too high, is the situation ready (or as conflict theorists
sometimes say, &quot;ripe,&quot;) for negotiation.</p>

<p>Many other problems occur relating to trading power as well.&nbsp; To see the full list
