<p>Sometime negotiation fails because the process was badly designed or implemented.
Countless mistakes can be made-the wrong parties can be at the table, important parties
might be missing, the issues can be misidentified or dealt with out of order, the process
can be too complex with too many steps, or so short and simple that important facts or
opinions are not considered. If goals are unclear, the process can wander from one topic
to the next, without reaching closure or coming to any decisions. The process might be so
inflexible that it cannot be adjusted to fit changed situations. Or it might be so
flexible that parties can do anything they want to delay it, thus allowing a disputant who
would prefer that nothing be changed to delay the decision making process indefinitely so
that the do-nothing option is chosen by default. </p>

<p>When the process is poor, decisions, if made at all, are likely to be poor as well.
They may not reflect the interests or needs of the parties in the dispute, or they might
not be technically, economically, socially, or politically feasible. More often, however,
the negotiation or mediation effort will simply break down, and no decision will be made.
This forces the parties to pursue more risky and costly options if they want to continue
confronting the dispute, to start negotiating all over again with a better process (which
is costly in terms of time at least) or to abandon efforts to obtain a decision which
improves their situation. </p>
