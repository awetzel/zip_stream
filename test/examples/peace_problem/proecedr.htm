<p>Before the parties can constructively address the core substantive issues they must
limit the distracting effects of procedural disputes. While people do not always expect to
be victorious, they do expect to be treated fairly. (What is considered &quot;fair,&quot;
of course, changes from one culture to the next.) Violations of generally-accepted
principles of fairness can easily divert attention from the core, substantive issues and
become the central focus of a controversy. This may also broaden the scope of the conflict
considerably as others, who feel their procedural rights are threatened, are drawn into
the dispute. </p>

<p>Some procedural problems involve excluded parties. If parties to a conflict are
excluded from the decision-making process, or their concerns are overlooked and not
addressed, they may get upset with the process, regardless of what decision is made. At
other times, people are supposedly involved in the process, but they do not feel they are
being represented adequately, or they may not be listened to respectfully, or their ideas
considered. </p>

<p>Other procedural problems involve issues of power. Power, by definition, means the
ability to get something done. So high power groups generally have more ability to design
procedures to their liking, and to press for outcomes that favor themselves. Yet decision
making structures that favor high power groups over low power groups are likely to be
distrusted by low power groups, who may fight the decision making process as well as the
outcome, further complicating the conflict and making any dispute resolution procedures
more difficult. However, structures that redistribute power to traditionally low power
groups are likely to be viewed negatively by dominant parties, unless it is done in
clearly legitimate ways. </p>

<p>Other procedural problems involve processes which are too slow or too fast. Lengthy and
elaborate grievance-review processes, which may be intended to be fair, can also be seen
as delaying tactics designed to avoid dealing with injustice under the guise of careful
and fair deliberation. Or decisions can be rushed through before anyone notices that
something unfair has just been done. Both approaches are likely to anger people and make
conflicts worse, not better. Other process problems involve a lack of clear goals which
makes effective action almost impossible, and a level of complexity which is so high that
no one can figure out how to proceed. For more discussion of procedural problems, see the
various items below. </p>
