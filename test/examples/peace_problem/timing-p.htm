<p>Sometimes negotiation or mediation does not work because it is not timed properly.
Disputants will usually not agree to negotiation unless they think that they can do at
least as well--or better-- in a negotiation process as they can by using another form of
confrontation, usually some form of force. Before they are willing to negotiate, they will
insist that this power contest be played out--or at least pursued long enough to foresee
the end result--before they will be willing to sit down and negotiate. </p>

<p>In their well-known book, <em>Getting to Yes</em>, Roger Fisher and William Ury
describe this idea as &quot;BATNA&quot;--best alternative to a negotiated agreement. If
one or more of the disputants has a BATNA that is substantially better than what they
think they can get through negotiation, they are likely to refuse to negotiate, turning to
their BATNA instead. Thus disputes are not ready or &quot;ripe&quot; for negotiation (as
it is commonly called) until all the sides know and have tested their BATNAs. Only after
they have tested their BATNAs, and concluded that they are inferior to negotiation, will
parties be willing to negotiate an end to their struggle.</p>

<p>Relying on BATNAs can take many forms. Insurgent groups may refuse to negotiate with
the regime they oppose because they think they can win more by continuing violent
confrontation than they could in negotiation. The dispute will not become ripe for
negotiation until one side or the other gives up, realizing that a negotiated settlement
between opponents will likely yield a better result.</p>

<p>Similar problems can occur in public policy conflicts, intergroup conflicts, or even
interpersonal conflicts. An environmental group, for instance, may refuse to negotiate
about the construction of a new facility if they think they can block that construction in
court. Ethnic groups may refuse to negotiate power sharing arrangements if they think they
can do better through legal or political processes. The same thing happens in
interpersonal conflicts. If people in conflict think they can win by using force to coerce
the other person into complying with their wishes, they are likely to do that instead of
negotiating. Only after force has failed, or after the results of force become clear, will
the disputants be willing to consider negotiation.</p>

    Role in Preventive Diplomacy</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Bercovitch examines 241 international conflicts occurring from 1945 to 1990. Mediation
    was attempted, often multiple times, in 60% of those conflicts. Bercovitch examines the
    factors that correlate with mediation success and failure.&nbsp; One important factor he
    found was timing.</dd>

  <dd>McCarthy compares two mediation efforts in Northern Ireland.&nbsp; The latter was more
    successful than the former, at least in part because of its better timing.</dd>
