<p></strong>Conflicts are resolved in ways which favor the most powerful. Here power is
determined by what people have to trade, what types of force they are able to use, and the
degree to which their goals are viewed as legitimate. There are, unfortunately, cases in
which unjustly treated groups may lack the power that they need to correct the situation.
They may not have items to trade in exchange relationships and they may not have the
ability to force others to address their grievances. They may also lack legitimacy because
they belong to minority groups which are discriminated against by the larger society. This
is especially likely to occur in cases where the parties have competing and contradictory
moral beliefs and the minority group refuses to recognize the wisdom of the majority's
moral principles. The result may be that there is no short-term remedy for the injustice
is being suffered by these groups. <strong></p>
</strong></font>

<p>In some cases such power differences are appropriate and just. For example,
governments, police and military forces in broadly supported, democratic political systems
should be more powerful than small paramilitary hate groups that are focused on a racist
agenda. People who are trying to assemble a broad-based coalition that advances the
interests of all citizens should be more powerful than those who are pursuing narrow,
selfish, and greedy objectives. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, sometimes the distribution of power favors narrow selfish interests, at
the expense of the interests of the broader society. In these cases individuals, small
groups, or even small communities are subjected to overwhelming and often physical force
which they are powerless to resist, yet which is being used to pursue&nbsp; objectives
which would be deemed by the outside world to be illegitimate and unjust. In the most
extreme cases, this involves individuals who are subjected to imprisonment, torture,
&quot;disappearance,&quot; or killing for political reasons.&nbsp; This kind of&nbsp;
persecution is often associated with the persecution of racial and ethnic groups.</p>

<p>In these cases, victims are likely to feel that they do not have an effective strategy
for defending their interests and resisting injustice. As a result, they give up and
&nbsp; decide to accept the injustice. They may also abandon nonviolent approaches in the
belief that violent resistance&nbsp;offers their only hope. The result may be a series of
highly destructive confrontations in which the disempowered parties make little progress
in protecting their interests or rights.</p>

<p>What makes this outcome so tragic is that the parties often do have viable options for
defending their rights, even in seemingly hopeless situations. In general these options
require the parties to frame the conflict in terms of the collective pursuit of universal
principles of justice which all sides have a stake in supporting. (Purely selfish appeals
are much less likely to be successful.)&nbsp; In addition, while there is, unfortunately,
no quick and easy strategy for correcting the &quot;tyranny of the powerful&quot; problem,
over the long-term, the key is to find some way for less powerful parties to build their
power base. This tends to involve empowerment, coalition building, collective security,
legitimacy building&nbsp;(see treatments below).</p>

  <dd>This article argues that sanctions tend to be less effective against autocratic regimes
    because the leaders are able to divert the effects away from themselves onto their
    relatively powerless population.</dd>
