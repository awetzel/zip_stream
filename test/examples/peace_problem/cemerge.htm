<p>Every conflict begins with a latency period (a period when the potential for conflict
exists, but it has not yet developed). Latent conflict may exist for very long periods
before it becomes visible and the conflict actors are conscious of it and behave
accordingly. (Deutsch 1973) In fact, it may never emerge. An alienating social structure
tends to suppress the emergence of social conflict. Marx (1978) saw capitalism alienating
workers from their labor and from one another, inhibiting open class conflict. That
alienation was masked by a culture shaped by the ruling class for the maintenance of its
position. (Gramsci 1971) When race was added to political, economic and cultural control
in a society, as in the colonized world, obstacles to conflict's emergence were even more
considerable. (Fanon 1968 ) In Collins view (1975), social life is above all a struggle
for power and status regardless of the type of structure. An inevitable power differential
between groups, and between individuals, produces latent conflict in all social relations.
But Collins (1992) also points out that the power of those higher on the power
differential ladder is restricted in a number of important ways. Those restrictions permit
the lower-power actor considerable freedom of action.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Transforming latent into manifest conflict is problematic.&nbsp; As conflict emerges,
it produces considerable confusion. Interaction of the conflict parties changes, sometimes
radically and abruptly. Levels of unpredictability, uncertainty and emotion rise. Unwise
and costly decisions are made from a lack of understanding of what is occurring. Since how
a conflict emerges largely determines how costly it will subsequently be, those involved
must have the clearest understanding possible of what is going on.&nbsp; Can a conflict be
resolved in its latent stage through structural reform? If not, will the emergence process
be characterized by less or more costly conflict methods? How can the opposing parties do
the conflict most economically and least harmfully?&nbsp; </p>
