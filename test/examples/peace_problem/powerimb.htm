<p>In most conflict situations, one party has more power than another. When the power
differential is substantial, this usually has a significant effect on both the substance
and process of the dispute. Generally, it is believed that the power of the parties must
be relatively even if a negotiation or mediation process is to be fair. If one side is far
more powerful than another, they are likely to simply impose their solution on the other
side, who will be forced to accept it, because they have no other choice. (Using Fisher
and Ury's term, they have no &quot;BATNA.&quot;) </p>

<p>Alternatively, the high power party may simply refuse to enter into a negotiation,
because they have no need to. They can get what they want without compromising, or in any
way giving in to the other side. So they pursue their alternative(s) to negotiation, which
usually involve persuasion and/or force. (Advocates of the low-power side might refer to
any effort at persuasion as co-optation or propaganda, however.) A third possibility is
that the low-power party will refuse to negotiate, because they fear they will be co-opted
or otherwise forced to make compromises they do not want to make. Low power parties often
engage in advocacy and violent or nonviolent direct action in an effort to build their
power before they are willing to enter into a negotiation process.</p>

<p>Although gross power imbalances are a problem for conflict resolution, so too is
equality of power. Quincy Wright, one of the most respected scholars in the field of war
defined war as a conflict of feelings, cultures, armed force, and legal institutions <em>&quot;so
nearly equal as to lead to the extreme intensification of each.&quot; </em>By this Wright
meant that the power of the two sides were so closely matched that neither side could
quickly prevail, forcing both sides into a highly escalated and protracted struggle that
has almost no bounds. Indeed, it is often argued that wars or other deep-rooted
international or ethnic conflicts cannot be resolved until they become &quot;ripe.&quot; A
variety of factors contribute to &quot;ripeness,&quot; but one of the most commonly
agreed-upon factors is that a conflict has reached a hurting stalemate-a situation in
which it has become clear to both sides that neither side can ever win, and the costs of
continuing the struggle are far higher than the costs of ending it. While it takes
equality of power to reach this point, the losses entailed in so doing are extremely
severe. Thus, both power equality and power inequality pose challenges and problems for
dispute resolvers.</p>
