<p>The leaders of groups involved in intractable conflicts frequently ask their
constituents to make enormous sacrifices in pursuit of the group's overall objectives. In
addition to time and money, constituents are frequently asked to endure enormous hardship,
personal injury, and even death. People are willing to make these sacrifices because they
believe that there are no less costly ways to protect their vital interests. This means
that the ability of leaders to retain their positions requires that they continue to
persuade their constituents that they have chosen the best course of action.&nbsp; It is
often politically unacceptable for the leaders to admit that they have made a mistake and
that the sacrifices made have achieved nothing--or worse,&nbsp; may even have hurt the
group's ability to pursue its interests. People who actually make the sacrifices are also
understandably reluctant to admit that they have served no useful purpose and that their
confrontation strategy should be abandoned. For example, it is far easier to believe that
your son was killed in a noble crusade, rather than in a stupid blunder. Since they want
to believe they are right,&nbsp; people are often very reluctant to abandon failed
strategies, and this reluctance, ironically, tends to increase as the magnitude of the
sacrifice increases. This problem, for example, helps explain why the United States
continued to pursue conflict in Vietnam long after it became clear that it was a serious
mistake.
