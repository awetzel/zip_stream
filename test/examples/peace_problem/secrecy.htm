<p><font SIZE="+2">Confrontations tend to be more constructive if the parties have an
accurate image of the interests, positions, and actions of the other parties. Actions
based on inaccurate understandings of the situation are much less likely to achieve their
desired objectives and much more likely to unnecessarily antagonize opponents.
Nevertheless, distorting an opponents' image of the situation can often produce
significant tactical advantages. Such distortions can arise from secrets as well as
spreading deceptive information.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">For example, a military force which can keep its attack plans secret is
much more likely to be able to launch a surprise attack which will find opponents
unprepared and less able to defend themselves. This same general principle can be applied
to political campaigns, in which the sudden release of a damaging piece of information can
cause greater harm&nbsp; if the opponent does not have an opportunity to anticipate the
release of the information and implement a preemptive damage-control strategy. Similar
surprises can contribute to the effectiveness of other types of force as well. Not
surprisingly it is common for disputing parties (especially, nation states) to devote
enormous amounts of effort to the protection of their own secrets and the discovery of the
secrets of their opponents.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Deception is a related strategy in which the parties attempt to gain a
tactical advantage by distorting, rather than concealing, information. For example,
military leaders might attempt to convince opponents that their forces are stronger than
they actually are. In this case, the parties deliberately try to give their opponents an
inaccurate and tactically advantageous image of the situation.&nbsp; Similarly, parties
might indicate that they have better alternatives to a negotiated agreement (<a
href="batna.htm">BATNAs</a>) than they really do.&nbsp; Since better BATNAs mean more
power, if you can convince your opponent that your BATNA is better than their own, this
will give you a negotiating advantage.&nbsp; Another example might be that people opposed
to the construction of a new chemical plant in their neighborhood might exaggerate the
health risks associated with such a plant to give them more influence in the decision
making process.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">While these techniques are certainly capable of strengthening the
positions of people who use them, they have costs and risks that often outweigh the
benefits.&nbsp; First and most obviously, it makes it extremely difficult for the parties
develop trust for one another. This distrust can, in turn, make efforts to negotiate
agreements.&nbsp; This is especially true in disarmament negotiations, because the &nbsp;
parties are likely to conclude that they can't take the risk that their opponent will
cheat, so they won't agree to anything at all. A history of secrecy and deception also
increases the chances that the parties' will develop worst-case images of one another.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">A third problem with secrecy and deception is that it makes it hard for
either side to develop an accurate image of the real interests or needs of the other(s).
&nbsp; This makes effective interest-based bargaining or needs-based processes such as
analytical problem solving practically impossible to implement. This, in turn, makes the
development of win-win outcomes almost impossible.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Avoiding the problems associated with secrecy and deception does not,
however, mean that the parties need to tell each other everything, or that negotiators
need to tell their constituents everything. People often need to be able to consider
controversial ideas without fear that early release of incomplete ideas will become a
source of conflict. Without this limited secrecy, which is often referred to as
confidentiality, parties to discussions may be completely unwilling consider the difficult
issues. Here, <a href="../treatment/grules.htm">ground rules</a> can often be used to give
the parties better information about when it is and is not appropriate to release
information about ongoing discussions. </font></p>

  <dd>In this case study, one of the parties kept crucial data secret which made negotiations
    very difficult and much more expensive for the opponents who had to collect independent
    data on their own.&nbsp; This independent data collection then led to a credibility
    problem on both sides.</dd>
