<h1 align="center">The Ways in Which This Program Can be Used</h1>

<hr>

<p>This program can be used in a variety of ways. It can be searched quickly to find a
solution to a particular problem. Or it can be studied in some detail--to learn more about
resolution-resistant conflicts in general and how they can be most effectively approached.
The program can be used by itself by people who have little or no experience in conflict
management. It can also be used, however, to supplement other conflict management training
or reading. Since we take a somewhat different approach to conflict management and
resolution than is common among our colleagues, the material on this website is likely to
give users a new perspective and additional ideas about how best to confront difficult
conflict situations.</p>

<p>All the information on this web-site is available for free. Users can study as much or
as little as they wish without incurring any costs (beyond computer access costs).
However, a certificate of completion and/or university credit is available (for a small
fee) for those who want to work through the formal course material and complete the
assignments. For more information on these options, choose one of the items below.

  <dt><strong><a href="../online_consulting.htm">Online Consulting</a></strong> </dt>
  <dd>Our on-line consulting service begins by presenting a list of typical conflict problems.
    &nbsp; Potential solutions to each problem are then offered along with examples and
    background information.&nbsp; People who just want a limited amount of information about a
    few problems should use this approach to the system.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="../training_options.htm">Online Training and Education</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>The training and education option is available for people who want more information
    about a broader range of topics.&nbsp; In addition to the problem and solution material
    used for online consulting, people wanting more extensive training or education should
    read the background theoretical essays, as well as the examples which are linked to the
    problem and solution write up. The core training program consists of ten basic units--one
    on the introductory theory, and nine others, each focusing on a particular category of
    problem. Each unit has a overview section and a number of more specialized sub-sections
    describing common problems and potential solutions.&nbsp; Examples give more information
    about particular problems, or how solutions have been applied in different situations.</dd>

  <dd>This program is designed so that it can be used by both adversaries and people in
    intermediary roles (such as mediators or facilitators).</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="../disclaimers.htm">Program Limitations</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Crucial to using this training program effectively is an clear understanding of what the
    program's many materials are and are not intended to do.&nbsp; </dd>
