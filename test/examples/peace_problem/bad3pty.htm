<p>Many facilitated dialogues and mediation efforts fail because the facilitator or
mediator does not do a good job or lacks credibility with one or more sides to the
conflict. One of the most common problems is that the third party is perceived to be
unfair. He or she may be perceived to favor one side over another, or may be thought to be
more interested in their own, third, agenda, rather than the interests and/or needs of the
disputants themselves. Another problem may be that the third party does not have an
adequate background to do a good job. He or she may not understand the nature of the
dispute well enough to be an effective facilitator, or she may not understand the parties'
cultural biases or constraints. If a mediator comes from a different culture than one or
all of the disputants, problems with mutual understanding and trust are often more
pronounced. </p>

<p>A related problem is the extent of commitment that the mediator makes. It is often said
that a conflict takes as long to get out of as it takes to get into. This means that
protracted conflicts, that have gone on for many years take may years to resolve. A
mediator who comes into a mediation process for a few weeks--or even months--but who is
not ready to really get to know the people and the cultures, and to stay with them for the
long term-will likely not be as trusted or be as effective as someone who is willing to
give the time and commitment necessary to see the long-running process through to its
conclusion.</p>

  <dd>Lederach discusses why the Persian Gulf War occurred and what might have been done to
    prevent it. Mediation was not tried, he said, because of differing notions in the U.S. and
    in Iraq regarding who would be a credible mediator.</dd>
