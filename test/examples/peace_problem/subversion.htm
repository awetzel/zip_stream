<p>People can also respond to threats by pretending to submit to the demands of the
threatening party while simultaneously and secretly defying the wishes of their opponent..
For example, threats are embodied in election laws which prohibit the bribery of public
officials. Still, it is often possible for interest groups to find ways to &nbsp;
&quot;reward&quot; government officials for their support.&nbsp; Or, in cases where
countries are attempting to enforce economic sanctions against another country, it is
often possible for businesses to get around the sanctions through smuggling or shipping
goods through intermediary countries which are not honoring the sanctions. </p>

<p>From a defensive perspective, this kind of deception can be used to reduce power
imbalances. For example, in cases where political activism on behalf of disempowered
communities is prohibited, it is often possible to establish a network of international
sympathizers who can coordinate protest activities and mobilize international supporters. </p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">In short, the effectiveness of force is limited in cases
where the threatening parties cannot reliably determine whether or not threatened parties
are complying with their demands. </font></p>
