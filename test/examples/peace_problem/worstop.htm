<p>Often disputants think that the most extreme individuals on the opposing side are, in
fact, representative of&nbsp; all other members of the opposing group.&nbsp;If a few
extremists on one side advocate violence or another form of force, their opponents may
assume, for instance, that their all their opponents will quickly turn to violence or
other form of force, and thus they must be prepared to resist, no matter what happens.
This often leads disputants to take more forceful actions of their own. But then the
opponents are likely to interpret these actions as unnecessarily aggressive, and use them
to justify their own worst-case planning. In addition, disputants sometimes assume that
all of their opponents approach the conflict in the same way.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The media tends to accentuate this problem, since they often give the most press
coverage to the most extreme people and statements.&nbsp; This, then leads people on the
other side to conclude that their opposition really is as outrageous as their most
outrageous individual members, while in reality, most of the opposition group, and even
the leadership may be much more moderate.</p>

<p>Usually there is a great deal of variation in the goals and&nbsp; motivations of a
group of advocates. A failure to recognize these differences or to employ different
strategies for individuals with different characteristics is likely to significantly
reduce one's effectiveness, while escalating the conflict more than is necessary. Further,
when all opponents are treated as extremists, they tend to become so in response to what
they perceive as overly harsh actions on the part of the other side. </p>
