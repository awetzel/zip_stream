<hr>

<p>All societies and groups are held together, at least to some extent, by social bonds.
These bonds relate to people's identities--their roles--in the group, community, and
society. In a strongly integrated society, most people have a multitude of identities and
roles. One person might be a husband, father, truck driver, Roman Catholic, tennis player,
who loves gardening and classical music.&nbsp; Another might be a wife, mother, teacher,
Moslem, social activist, who loves reading and studying foreign languages. Both of these
people have links to other people who live with them, work with them, or share their
interests. The more links between people, and the more active people are in different
social, political, and economic organizations, the more strongly they are tied to their
social system and the more strongly the social system is held together. </p>

<p>When societies are wracked by conflict or war, many of these identities and roles get
abandoned or submerged. People emphasize or focus on their primary group identity,
abandoning any links with people from the other side with whom they might have shared
experiences before the conflict began. In the Balkans, for example, one's identity as a
Muslim, Croat, or Serb became far more important than one's identity as a parent, a
teacher, a truck driver, or a scholar. People who worked side-by-side in Yugoslavia
routinely killed each other over these national identities, with no regard for the former
ties that had held them together, and had given them common bonds. In severely war-torn
societies, the only aspect of the integrative system that remains is the system that
operates within each side--bonding the factions together, but in opposition to the
other(s). Any remnants of an integrative system between groups can be lost, making
peacebuilding efforts very difficult, but at the same time terribly important if
long-term, stable peace is to be obtained.</p>

<h3><strong>Examples of Situations in which the Integrative System has Broken Down:</strong></h3>

<dl>
  <dt><strong><a HREF="../example/nye4152.htm">Joseph Nye, Jr. --&nbsp; International
    Conflicts After the Cold War</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Nye explores the nature and causes of global, regional, and communal conflicts after the
    Cold War and evaluates various approaches to conflict prevention. Lack of a strong
    integrative system is both a cause and a consequence of these conflicts.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><strong><a HREF="../example/sahn7033.htm">Mohamed Sahnoun -- Managing Conflicts in the
    Post-Cold War Era</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Sahnoun explores issues surrounding military and humanitarian interventions in civil and
    ethnic conflicts. Like Nye, Sahnoun observes that lack of a strong integrative system
    contributes to the escalation of these conflicts.</dd>
