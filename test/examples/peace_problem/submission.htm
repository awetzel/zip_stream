<p>Submission is probably the most common response to threats and force. Effectively
resisting threats often requires the parties to devote a great deal of their resources to
what is likely to be a painful confrontation. Often it is much easier to simply submit to
the demands of the threatening party and go back to pursuing normal activities. This is
especially attractive when the threatening party is not asking a great deal. Often people
devote an enormous amount of effort to fighting over things that are not really very
important.</p>

<p>It is only in cases where the threatening party wants people to do something that they
find absolutely unacceptable that resistance is worth the effort. Even in these cases, a
decision to resist depends upon the chances of succeeding. If a party doesn't have enough
power to resist, then the easiest thing to do is give up and to try to build up one's
power so one can stage a successful resistance later. </p>

<p>Another alternative is to mount a low-cost, low risk approach.&nbsp; Here exchange and
persuasion can be used instead of force to try to convince the threatening party to
withdraw the threat.&nbsp; In any case, however, parties need to take care to pick their
fights carefully and only engage in conflicts that are likely to significantly advance
their interests.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Submission can be a problem, however, when people or groups routinely submit to the
demands of others without ever considering the value of standing up for themselves. &nbsp;
While this may be appropriate in most cases, it is not in all--some fights are worth
fighting.&nbsp; When one's fundamental interests, values, or needs are at stake, people
should carefully consider what options they have for defending those, and think carefully
before submitting to the demands of others.</p>
