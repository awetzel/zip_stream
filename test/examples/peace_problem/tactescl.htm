<hr>

<p>Often parties will escalate a conflict intentionally, in an effort to build support for
their cause. Although heightening awareness of a problem is often necessary at early
stages of a conflict, there are ways to do that which are less likely to lead to an
uncontrolled escalation spiral. If controls or limits are not placed on potential
escalation-provoking behaviors, and care taken to build bridges to the other side at the
same time, escalation often gets out of control quickly and any benefits which might have
been obtained through escalation will be lost. </p>

    Preventative Diplomacy in Yugoslavia</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>In this analysis, Touval examines the reasons why preventive diplomacy failed to prevent
    the Yugoslavian war. One reason, he found was that economic hardships which resulted from
    political and economic reforms were exploited by faction leaders and used to fuel
    nationalistic fervor. </dd>
