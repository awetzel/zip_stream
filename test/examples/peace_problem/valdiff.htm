<p>Since effective persuasive arguments are usually based on common values, profound
differences in values between conflicting parties can make effective persuasion difficult.
If a conflict is primarily value based--that is, if it revolves around differing concepts
of good and bad, right and wrong--it can be very difficult to craft an effective
persuasive argument. That is because values usually cannot be changed simply by reason. </p>

<p>Values are deeply held beliefs-usually based on cultural traditions, long-held family
and religious teachings and long-lasting memories of personal experiences. Given their
sources, people's values seldom change, even when their more superficial desires (for
instance, their interests) are modified. &quot;Asking someone to adjust his values is like
asking him to alter his sense of reality,&quot; explain mediators Susan Carpenter and
W.J.D. Kennedy. While this can happen, it doesn't happen often or easily. For this reason,
values usually cannot be negotiated, nor can they be changed through persuasive arguments.</p>

<p>Value conflicts are even more difficult to deal with because the people in conflict may
not only disagree about the substance of a dispute, but they will often disagree about the
appropriate method of dispute resolution or dispute management as well. Given the lack of
agreement on both process and substance, parties involved in value conflicts tend to turn
to force-based conflict options more often than negotiation or persuasive approaches,
because force seems to be the only common language that both sides understand and honor.</p>

  <dd>One common source of profound value differences are cultural differences between
    disputants. While conflicts between members of different cultures can be resolved,
    cultural differences must be treated differently than simple differences in interests.</dd>

  <dd>This is a summary of Pearce and Littlejohn's book <em>Moral Conflict</em>. The book
    details the special problems created by value or moral conflicts and suggests new, more
    productive ways of expressing those conflicts and managing moral differences.</dd>
