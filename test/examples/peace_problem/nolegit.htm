<p>Effective persuasive arguments must be seen as legitimate and must come from
parties--individuals and groups--which are themselves perceived as legitimate. Kenneth
Boulding, who was perhaps the most eloquent proponent of the importance of the integrative
system, argued that legitimacy formed the core of that system. &quot;Legitimacy applies to
persons, to roles and occupations, to organizations, customs, habits, means of
communications, institutions--indeed there is hardly any aspect of society the development
and future of which are not profoundly determined by its position in the constantly
changing structure of legitimacy.&quot; (Boulding, 1989; p. 113.) </p>

<p>How legitimacy is obtained and/or lost, however, is not well understood. One source of
legitimacy is compliance with fundamental societal values and norms. If a leader obtains
his or her position through a process which is generally regarded as &quot;fair,&quot; if
he or she fulfills the leadership role in a way that corresponds with general wishes and
expectations of the people, then the leader is likely to have-and maintain legitimacy. If
the leader violates common expectations, however, their legitimacy may crumble. U.S.
President Nixon was one good example; Soviet Premier Gorbachev was another. They violated
their citizen's expectations about the appropriate behavior of a leader, and eventually
both lost their positions of power. Personal charm, or charisma, plays a role in
legitimacy as well, however. U.S. President Reagan violated political norms in the
Iran-Nicaraguan Contra scandal, just as much as Nixon had but Reagan did not lose his
legitimacy as a result, as his charisma was much stronger than Nixon's.</p>

<p>Thus, one's legitimacy is a critical factor in the effectiveness of one's persuasive
arguments. When persuasive arguments are made by people who are seen themselves to be
illegitimate, the arguments also will be viewed as illegitimate. Likewise, effective
persuasive arguments must be based on commonly held values and principles of fairness;
otherwise, they are likely to be dismissed as self-serving, naive, unreasonable, or simply
wrong.</p>

    International Conflicts After the Cold War</strong></u></font></a></dt>
  <dd>Nye reviews the causes and consequences of communal conflicts following the end of the
    Cold War. One cause he discusses is that traditional methods of mediating conflicts lose
    force in &quot;delegitimized states.&quot; Ethnic identities often offer alternative
    sources of legitimacy to leaders, making them much more persuasive in their efforts to
    arouse internal ethnic pride and cohesion, but often much less able to operate effectively
    between communal or ethnic groups.</dd>

    Falklands: Failure of a Mission</strong></u></font></a></dt>
  <dd>Effective mediators are seen as legitimate facilitators of negotiations, and their
    legitimacy enables them to successfully persuade the disputants to alter their hard-line
    stances and negotiate a mutually-agreeable settlement to their problem. The mediator in
    the Falklands case was not seen as legitimate, nor were the Argentinean negotiators. As a
    result, the Falklands mediation effort failed.</dd>

  <dd>Negotiations will not be successful unless all the parties view the other as legitimate,
    Kriesberg illustrates in this essay.</dd>
