<p></font><font size="3">Conflicts often arise when one person or group seeks to change
the behavior of another, but the other does not acknowledge that a problem exists, and
maintains that it is not their responsibility to deal with the problem or participate in
any efforts to resolve the issue. This is common in domination conflicts in which the
subordinate group sees its role as unjust, while the dominant group does not define the
situation as a problem at all. </p>

<p>Another version of the &quot;not my problem&quot; situation occurs when outside groups
define a situation as someone else's problem, when the people involved see it as involving
the larger region or the world. For example, often external powers allow severe human
rights abuses to take place in other nation states, maintaining that it is &quot;not their
problem&quot; or that they have no jurisdiction because it is occurring in a sovereign
state, over which they have no control. While the notion of sovereignty used to suggest
such a &quot;hands-off&quot; approach, with the increasing recognition of universal human
rights, external nations, regional organizations, and the UN are becoming involved in
&quot;internal&quot; disputes more often. </p>

<p>The question of when another nation should intervene is a very difficult one.
Typically, it is made in terms of self-interests, although moral considerations are
sometimes brought into the decision making process as well. </p>

  <dd>Sean Byrne suggests that the situation in Northern Ireland is not an internal problem,
    but rather a problem of the entire international community. The practical involvement of
    other countries, he argues, would be beneficial to the conflict's resolution.</dd>

  <dd>This is a summary of a report on a conference held in 1995 at the Colorado (USA)-based
    Aspen Institute on the Role of International Intervention. Like the Crocker article, this
    summary discusses types of situations in which intervention might be needed, how nations
    should decide when to intervene, and what guidelines such interventions should follow.</dd>
