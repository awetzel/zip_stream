<p>The term stalemate refers to the point at which the parties are using the maximum force
possible (or the maximum that they are willing to use), yet neither side is able to
prevail in the conflict. (To use a chess analogy, they have reached a &quot;draw.&quot; )
When the conflict is very violent or costly in emotional or economic terms, the situation
is often referred to as a &quot;hurting stalemate&quot;--a situation in which continuing
the conflict will bring only continued harm, without benefit. Once all the parties to a
conflict agree that the conflict has reached this stage, they are more likely to be
willing to negotiate at least a temporary settlement, since they can tell that continuing
the confrontation will do no them no good. </p>

<p>In their book <em>Social Conflict: Escalation, Stalemate, and Settlement</em> (1986),
Dean Pruitt and Jeffrey Rubin give four reasons stalemates may occur. First is the failure
of contentious tactics. Often, they observe contentious tactics that work early in the
conflict are not as effective later on, as the parties get to know just how far the other
will go and how they can counter any offensive effectively. The second cause of stalemate
is resource limits. Parties may run out of energy, money, or time. Third, they may run out
of people who are willing to continue the fight. If they can't win a conflict relatively
quickly and easily, people often get tired and want to give up. Fourth, the costs of
continuing the conflict may just be too high (if the situation is a hurting stalemate).
This was the situation, Pruitt and Rubin argue, in the Cuban Missile Crisis, because
neither side was willing to risk nuclear war in order to prevail.</p>

  <dd>This is a short article about a conflict between environmental advocates and the forest
