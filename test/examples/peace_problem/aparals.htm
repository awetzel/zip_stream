<p><font SIZE="+2">Dealing with uncertainty can be very difficult when it is not clear
what will happen if a dispute is resolved in a particular way. Often the parties attempt
to get around this problem by conducting more and more studies in hopes of eliminating all
uncertainty and finding a risk-free way of resolving the dispute or making a decision.
Unfortunately, this is usually technically impossible.&nbsp; Science is seldom able to
resolve complex issues completely, but only with in a range of uncertainty, which can
sometimes be very large. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">In these cases the additional studies accomplish little more than
delaying decisions and resolution of the dispute. This in turn, results in the
continuation of existing policies and actions which are often clearly worse than the other
options&nbsp;being considered by decision makers and disputants. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">For example, in the United States, we keep looking for a risk free way
of disposing of the waste from nuclear power plants. As a result, we conduct study after
study while the waste that has already been generated is stored near large cities under
conditions which everyone regards as unsafe.</font></p>
