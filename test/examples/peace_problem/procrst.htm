<p>Often disputants or third parties realize a conflict is getting out of hand, but they
delay corrective efforts until the situation is really unmanageable. This sometimes is
caused by the hope that the conflict will simply disappear if it is ignored.&nbsp; At
other times, it is caused by the disputant's discomfort with the particular conflict or
conflicts in general.&nbsp; Or, it may occur because the disputant or third party cannot
figure out what to do that is likely to make the situation better, rather than worse.</p>

<p>Sometimes, time does help resolve conflicts.&nbsp; Minor problems that seem like
important issues one day may seem trivial the next.&nbsp; So, at times, ignoring a
situation does make sense.&nbsp; However, if a conflict is escalating rapidly, that is
likely to be a dangerous choice.&nbsp; It usually makes sense to take steps to stop
escalation as soon as possible.&nbsp; If it is allowed to continue unchecked, conflicts
can quickly become almost impossible to deal with.&nbsp; On the other hand, if efforts are
made to resolve a conflict before the parties are ready to do so, the effort is likely to
meet with failure as well.&nbsp; Thus timing one's response--either as a party, or as a
third party intermediary--is of critical importance.</p>
