<p>Many people are poor listeners, even in everyday life. They tend to listen and think
about something else at the same time. This happens even more frequently when people are
in conflict. Rather than carefully attending to what the other person has said, many
people think about their response while the other person is talking. </p>

<p>In addition, they tend to interpret things to coincide with the views that they already
have. For this reason, they assume they know and understand what other people are saying,
because they assume that it corresponds to their own expectations about what the person is
likely to say or &quot;should&quot; be saying. Since people in conflict tend to develop
hostile and distrustful images of the other, their interpretation of things the other side
says or does is also likely to be hostile and distrustful. Ambiguous messages are
interpreted in the worst possible way; even clear messages tend to be ignored or
disregarded, if they are inconsistent with one's original negative view. </p>

<p>Such poor listening makes good communication almost impossible. No matter how much care
one person or group takes to communicate their concerns, values, interests, or needs in a
fair, clear, unthreatening way, if the listener is not willing to receive that information
in that way, the communication will fail.</p>
