<p><font SIZE="+2">The complexity of most issues makes it impossible to completely predict
what will happen if a particular decision is made or if a dispute is resolved in a
particular way.&nbsp; This is very clear in scientific and technical disputes (on the
severity or implications of greenhouse warming, for example), but it occurs in
non-scientific disputes as well.&nbsp; (For example, how many people will lose their jobs
if the government adopts a new economic policy.)&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Often even the best technical analyses are likely to leave an
irreducible element of uncertainty. In these cases the best that the experts are likely to
be able to do is identify a number of possible outcomes for each option. They may also be
able to make some estimate of the likelihood of each possible outcome. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">For example, an analysis of a new chemical plant might conclude that:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font SIZE="+2">There is a 90% chance that no serious accident will occur within the
    next twenty years, </font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="+2">There is a 9% chance that a minor accident will occur which will kill
    less than 10 people, </font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="+2">There is a 1% chance that a more major accident will occur that will
    kill 10 to 100 people, and </font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="+2">There is a 1/10 of 1% chance that a very serious will occur that of will
    kill 100 to 1000 people. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE="+2">In such a case it is up to the parties to decide whether the benefits
associated with the option make this level of risk acceptable. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Often, however, people (decision makers and/or the public) are very
reluctant to make such decisions.&nbsp; Rather, they avoid making any decision, preferring
to wait for more conclusive technical studies.&nbsp; This often leads to what we call
&quot;analysis paralysis&quot; when no decision is made, while study after study is
conducted.&nbsp; The end result is the status quo--which may be agreed to be the least
desirable option, but the one taken nevertheless, due to the decision makers' inability to
adequately deal with uncertainty.</font></p>

<h3><strong>Examples</strong></h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a HREF="../example/fish6037.htm"><strong>Roger Fischer, Elizabeth Kopelman and Andrea
    Schneider -- Understand the Message as They Hear it</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This essay illustrates how uncertainty created by misunderstandings can lead to tragic
    consequences.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="6038 " --><a HREF="../example/fish6038.htm"><strong>Roger
    Fischer, Elizabeth Kopelman and Andrea Schneider -- Consider the Other Side's Choice</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This short essay illustrates a method to assess the consequences of various actions.
    &nbsp; Had this been used by Saddam Hussein in the Gulf Crisis, the authors argue, the
    uncertainty about choices would have been clearer, and perhaps the war could have been
    avoided.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="7502" --> <strong><a href="../example/sand7502.htm">Peter M. Sandman--Explaining Environmental Risk</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>This article explains that the public assesses risk and uncertainty very differently
    from experts.&nbsp; It then suggests ways in which risk can be explained to the public so
    that they can make informed decisions.</dd>
