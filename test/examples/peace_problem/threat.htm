<p>While force ultimately rests on the ability of parties to harm their opponents in some
way, it is often unnecessary to actually inflict harm. Often a forcing party can compel an
opponent to submit by merely threatening to use force. The captain of a warship, for
example, might decide to surrender when confronted by an overwhelming naval force. In a
similar way, a criminal might decide to surrender once surrounded by overwhelming police
force. Colonial landowners might agree to transfer some of their land to indigenous
peoples as part of a land reform effort when it becomes clear that land reform laws are
fully backed by legislative and judicial institutions as well as the police. What makes
these threats successful is that they are believable.&nbsp; It is clear to the target that
the other side has the power--and is willing to use it--to get what they want.</p>

<p>Since threats promise a quick and easy victory, people often decide to give them try.
&nbsp; What they may fail to recognize, however, is that the use of threat has a number of
serious problems. First, threats do not work if they are not credible.&nbsp; This means
that you must be able and willing to carry out the threat if the other side fails to
comply with your demands. To do this you must go to the expense of building up your power
base, even if you do not plan to use it.&nbsp; If you do not have it, not only will your
current threat be ineffective, your future threats are unlikely to work as well.</p>

<p>Second, the use of threats and/or force tends to generate a backlash from the target
population.&nbsp; Even if the threat is not carried out, people do not likely to be
threatened and are likely to try to subvert or challenge any changes that are made as a
result of threats or the use of force. Thus threats and force and not only risky and
expensive; they are also unstable, and parties who are forced to take actions against
their will are likely to try to reverse those actions (or any decision made) as soon as
possible. </p>

<p>This problem can be minimized if the use of threat and force is based on commonly held
moral values or principles, and is therefore more likely to be considered legitimate, even
by the target.&nbsp; Also, if threat is not used alone, but is linked with integrative or
exchange strategies (in what we call a <a href="../treatment/psmix.htm">power strategy
mix)</a>, the threat (or actual use of force) is less likely to create a backlash than if
threat or force is used alone. </p>
