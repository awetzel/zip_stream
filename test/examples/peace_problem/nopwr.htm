<p>In the alternative dispute resolution movement in the United States, negotiation and
other related forms of alternative dispute resolution are commonly portrayed as superior
alternatives to more confrontational, force-based dispute resolution strategies--for
example litigation. One claim that is commonly made is that mediation and negotiation are
ways for the parties themselves to maintain control of the decision making process, and
for power to be equalized between all participants. As we have said elsewhere in these
materials, the notion that negotiation and mediation are independent of power, or that
power is automatically equalized by participation in these processes is not true. Higher
power parties usually have better resources and skills which will help them in the
negotiation process. They often have superior alternatives to a negotiated settlement
(BATNAs) as well, which gives them considerably more power in the negotiations themselves.
</p>

<p>For this reason, low power parties often want higher power parties to agree to abandon
their BATNAs-their power based alternatives to negotiation-as a precondition to starting
negotiations. This will increase the likelihood that the power of the two sides at the
negotiating table will be closer to equal. High power parties are unlikely to want to
agree to such a stipulation however. If they agree to give up their power-based options,
this essentially binds them to the negotiation or mediation process no matter how it comes
out. Stripping them of their right to withdraw eliminates one aspect of their ability to
maintain control of the decision making process-thereby negating one of the key features
that is supposed to make negotiation and mediation superior to force-based confrontation
strategies</p>
