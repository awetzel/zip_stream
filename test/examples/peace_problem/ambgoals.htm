<p>Often people who are confused about what the conflict is really about or what is
important to them will have ambiguous (that is, confused) goals. Just as you cannot walk
to a destination if you don't know where it is, you cannot achieve your goals if you don't
know what they are. Goal ambiguity also results in ineffective actions which can confuse
or even enrage the other side, often needlessly. Thus, goal confusion can lead to
escalation of a conflict, which makes resolution more difficult. </p>

<p>One of the factors that contributes to such confusion is that goals change over time as
the situation changes. Sometimes goals get clearer and more narrowly defined; at other
times they get broader. When conflicts escalate, the parties' goals can change from an
initial goal to get one's own way to a later goal of depriving the other or hurting the
other. When the goal becomes damaging the opponent, rather than helping oneself, conflicts
tend to get protracted and destructive. </p>

<p>Goal ambiguity is also a problem for third parties who enter a conflict to
&quot;help.&quot; If they do not understand what their own goals are for involvement, they
can easily do more harm than good. Third party intermediaries must clearly understand what
the parties want them to do, what they themselves want to do, and how both of these goals
relate to what is actually possible. While the third party's goals also may change over
time, if they see that their initial goal to help the parties deal with the conflict more
effectively cannot be achieved, they should be sure to withdraw from the conflict before
they do more harm than good.</p>

    Case Study: Lessons of Preventative Diplomacy in Yugoslavia</strong></a></font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Times New Roman">This article describes the failure of diplomacy in
    preventing the war in Yugoslavia. Touval argued that Western preventive diplomacy failed
    in Yugoslavia for two reasons: one was the West's ambiguity regarding its goals for the
    region, and the other was that the diplomatic efforts of the West lacked credible
    leverage.</font></dd>

    Intervention</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Anderson argues that humanitarian aid provided by NGOs often makes conflicts worse, even
    as they are trying to help. This is due, in part, to confused NGO goals and mandates, and
    to the unintended consequences of altruistic plans. </dd>
