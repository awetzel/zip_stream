<p><a href="framing.htm">Framing </a>is the process through which individuals determine
the goals they wish to pursue through a conflict process. Scoping is the related process
of identifying the other parties who are likely to become involved in the conflict. (These
parties include adversaries, allies, intermediaries, decision makers, the media and
others.) Scoping also identifies the goals that the parties are likely to pursue, probable
points of conflict, and favored conflict strategies.&nbsp; This requires an understanding
of the image that different parties have of the situation (in other words, how they frame
the conflict), along with their interests, positions, and actions.&nbsp; It is also
important to examine the history of recent disputes, the way that they were resolved, and
the context in which future disputes will be addressed.&nbsp; Care should be taken to make
this assessment as accurate as possible, or else it will not be useful.&nbsp; One must go
beyond the simple stereotypes which most groups have of&nbsp; their opponents. This means
that one key to effective scoping is an ability to overcome the problems which commonly
plague <a href="commprob.htm">communication</a> and<a href="factfinding.htm"> fact-finding</a>
efforts.</p>

<p>In analyzing the scope of a conflict, it is important to remember that conflict is a<a
href="../conflict_term.htm"> long-term</a> process which is composed of a continuing
series of dispute episodes which may be resolved by mutual agreement, or, more likely, by
some type of<a href="force.htm"> force-based process</a> involving political, legal, and
military or other types of force. It is also important to remember that a number of
different, underlying conflicts are likely to be involved in each dispute. </p>

<p>Scoping also requires the parties to recognize that the level of interest and
involvement of the parties changes over time. There are likely to be parties who suddenly
become actively involved in a conflict, even though they may have initially appeared to be
uninterested. Often this occurs as parties learn more about how they might be adversely
affected by the efforts of others. Some parties will, for example, see the conflict as a
moral contest between good and evil, while others may view it as a question of individual
freedom and the right of everyone to live according to their own values. Still others may
see it as a distributional conflict in which the parties are all competing for the largest
possible share of the common resource (money or land, for example). </p>

<p>Parties who fail to adequately understand the scope of a conflict are likely to be
continually surprised by the actions of others. As a result they are likely to pursue
strategies which are less likely to advance&nbsp; their interests. This section highlights
a number of problems which limit the ability of the parties to adequately understand the
scope of the conflict along with strategies for overcoming these problems. </p>
