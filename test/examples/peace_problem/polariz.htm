<p>Polarization is the process that causes people who had been staying neutral to take
sides in a conflict. It also causes the people on the two sides to take increasingly
extreme positions-becoming more and more opposed to each other and more clearly defined as
&quot;different&quot; from the other (hence moving toward the &quot;poles&quot; or
becoming &quot;polar opposites.&quot; </p>

<p>Paul Olczak and Dean Pruitt (1995) see polarization as the second of four stages of
conflict escalation. During the first stage the conflict is not particularly escalated.
Perceptions of the opponent are relatively accurate (not stereotyped) and the parties
still have a good relationship. As a result, they are likely to want to try to find a
win-win solution. However, conflicts often escalate to a second stage, which they call
polarization. As conflicts polarize, they say, &quot;trust and respect are threatened, and
distorted perceptions and simplified stereotypes emerge.&quot; (Olczak and Pruitt, 1995,
p. 81.) Enemy images are formed, even to the point where the enemy is considered less than
human, and hence not worthy of respect or what might have previously been considered
&quot;fair&quot; treatment. Olczak and Pruitt's third stage is segregation, which is
actually a second level of polarization. In this stage, the conflict is characterized by
competition and hostility, and threatens the parties' basic needs. The last stage--going
beyond polarization--is destruction. Here the parties' goals cease to be winning, and
instead becomes destroying the other.</p>

<p>Like other aspects of escalation, polarization is a very destructive process that makes
managing and resolving conflicts much more difficult. However, Olczak and Pruitt suggested
that polarized conflicts are easier to de-escalate than conflicts that have reached the
third or fourth stages of escalation. </p>

  <dd>Pearce and Littlejohn explore how moral conflicts (we call them value conflicts) differ
    from conflicts over interests and needs. One argument they make is that the &quot;normal
    ways&quot; of handling interest-based conflicts are inappropriate in the case of moral
    conflicts, and may even tend to polarize these conflicts further.</dd>
