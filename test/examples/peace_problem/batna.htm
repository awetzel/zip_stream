<p>The success of negotiation is limited by a number of factors. One of these is the
presence of better alternatives to the expected negotiated agreement. In their
best-selling book, <em>Getting to Yes</em>, (1981) Roger Fisher and William Ury developed
the idea of &quot;BATNA,&quot; which stands for &quot;Best Alternative to a Negotiated
Agreement.&quot; Fisher and Ury counsel all negotiators to know--and when possible
improve--their BATNA. In order to know whether or not to accept a proposed settlement
obtained through negotiation, you must know whether or not you can get a better outcome in
some other way. If the negotiated agreement is better than your &quot;best
alternative,&quot; you should take it. If it is not as good as your BATNA, however, you
should either go back to the negotiating table to try again, or leave the table to pursue
your other option(s). </p>

<p>Since the disputants with the best BATNAs have the best negotiating position, it is
important to improve your BATNA whenever possible. Good negotiators know when their
opponent is desperate for an agreement. When that occurs, they will demand much more,
knowing their opponent will have to give in. If the opponent apparently has many options
outside of negotiation, however, they are likely to get many more concessions, in an
effort to keep them at the negotiating table. Thus making your BATNA as strong as possible
before negotiating, and then making that BATNA known to your opponent will strengthen your
negotiating position.</p>

<p>Guy Burgess and Heidi Burgess have adapted the concept of BATNA slightly to emphasize
what they call &quot;EATNAs--&quot;estimated alternatives to a negotiated agreement&quot;
instead of &quot;best alternatives.&quot; Even when disputants do not have good options
outside of negotiations, they often think they do. (For example, both sides may <em>think </em>that
they can prevail in a political, economic, or military struggle, even when one side is
clearly weaker, or when the relative strengths are so balanced that the outcome is very
uncertain.) Yet, perceptions are all that matter. If a disputant thinks that he or she has
a better option, she will, most likely, pursue that option, even if it is not as good as
she thinks it is.</p>

<p>The allure of the EATNA often leads to last-minute breakdowns in negotiations.
Disputants can negotiate for months or even years, finally developing an agreement that
they think is acceptable to all. But then at the end, all the parties must take a hard
look at the final outcome and decide &quot;is this better than all of my
alternatives?&quot; Only if all the parties say &quot;yes,&quot; can the agreement be
finalized. If just one party changes his or her mind, the agreement will break down. Thus
knowing one's own and one's opponent's EATNAs is critical to successful negotiation.</p>
