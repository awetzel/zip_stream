<p>In the United States, public decision makers are required to involve the public in most
decision making processes. The most common way to do this is to hold public hearings,
although advisory groups, focus groups, surveys, and other methods are also used. While
allowing decision makers to better gauge the interests and needs of the public, these
processes also slow down decision making--sometimes to a considerable extent. When a
problem is critical and there is a need to make a decision quickly, there is a strong
incentive to try to shortcut the public involvement processes as much as possible, so that
the decision can be made in a timely manner. </p>

<p>Decision makers are also sometimes tempted to rush decisions when they know the
decision they need to make is controversial. In such a case public involvement is likely
to be lengthy and inconclusive-some people will argue one way, others will want the
opposite to occur. Decision makers may feel that listening to this give and take doesn't
give them any more information than they already have, and it slows down the decision
process. Other decision makers may hope that if they make a decision quickly, it won't get
noticed as much, and won't become as controversial as it would be if the public
participated in the deliberations. &quot;Just do it!&quot; is the approach some advocate.</p>

<p>However, rushed decisions often make people so angry that they will do whatever they
can to block implementation of the decision after it is made. If legally required
procedures were violated, they can challenge the decision in court. They can also try to
block implementation through administrative channels, or can try to remove the decision
makers and get the decision reversed. So trying to make decisions quickly often has the
opposite effect of slowing the decision making process down, or stopping implementation of
needed decisions completely.</p>
