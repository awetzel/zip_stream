<p>It is usually time consuming, costly, and often deadly to pursue force-based strategies
to the bitter end--the point at which one side emerges as the clear victor and the other
is utterly destroyed. In the most extreme example, all out war, bitter-end conflict may be
pursued to the point where the loser's property is seized or destroyed and the population
enslaved or subjected to physical or cultural genocide. In cases where the balance of
power is more equal, the result may be a lengthy stalemate in which the two sides
progressively destroy one another with neither side emerging as a clear victor. </p>

<p>In bitter-end conflicts, the parties use all of the powers that they have available in
attempt to prevail. This tends to include extreme strategies such as terror and attacks
upon civilians, which would normally be considered immoral, but which are accepted because
of the seriousness of the situation. The result is a situation in which <a
href="escalation.htm">escalation</a> spins completely out of control. In these conflicts,
the parties never reach a point of accommodation in which they recognize and accept their
power disparities and agree to cooperate on matters of mutual interest while continuing to
struggle with the core issues which divide them.</p>

<p>The nature of bitter end struggles varies depending upon whether or not the conflict is
occurring in the context of a stable political system with effective limits on the use of
violent strategies, or whether violence is the ultimate option available to the parties.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The earlier violent examples illustrate the type of confrontations which
occur when effective violence-limiting mechanisms are absent.&nbsp; Bitter end
confrontation can also arise in non-violent, non-military conflicts such as labor strikes
in which management tries to break the union, regardless of the cost or the ill effects
this may have upon the company. Political parties can also engage in all out confrontation
where every possible tactic will be used to destroy the other side. </p>

<p>The pursuit of conflicts to the bitter-end tends to produce situations in which
transaction costs -- the cost of pursuing the conflict (measured in terms of time, money
and human lives) -- far exceeds either the benefits of victory (or the all-out defense of
a losing cause). The principle alternative to such bitter end confrontation are <a
href="../treatment/shortcut.htm">power contest shortcuts</a> and the use of <a
href="../treatment/ngloops.htm">negotiation loop-back</a> strategies.&nbsp; The use of
these shortcuts and loopbacks seldom changes the outcome of a conflict, though it will
reduce the transaction costs.&nbsp; The earlier such shortcuts are taken, the more costs
are likely to be saved.</p>
