<h1 align="center">Failure to Understand the Relationship Between Offensive and Defensive
Uses of Force</h1>

<hr>

<p>The problems and treatment strategies associated with the use of force vary depending
upon a party's perspective. When people are using force offensively they think about it
differently that when they are using it defensively. It is, therefore important to
consider problems associated with the use of force from both offensive and defensive
perspectives. </p>

<p>Offensive uses of force occur when people seek to advance their interests by forcing
others to do what they want. When viewed from this perspective, the parties are primarily
interested in ways of overcoming problems which undermine the effectiveness of force.
Their goal is to make inexpensive <a href="threat.htm">threats</a> which quickly force
their opponent to submit to their demands.</p>

<p>Force-based strategies are very different when viewed from the defensive perspective.
In this situation people want to know how they can resist threats made by others. Here
they are likely to be interested in strategies such as: defense, deterrence, defiance
(bluff calling), counter-threat (which run the risk of an arms race), flight, and
subversion (in which they pretend to submit while actually resisting). They also want to
know whether or not they have the power to make any of these resistance strategies
actually work.</p>

<p>In practice most people are simultaneously involved in both offensive and defensive
strategies.
