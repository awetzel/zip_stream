<p><big>At the most basic level, all that it takes to reach an agreement is to find some
formula which leaves all parties better off than they would otherwise expect to be. While
this criteria produces a so called &quot;win-win&quot; solution, it does not necessarily
produce a fair solution. For example, consider a hypothetical situation in which two
parties agree to contribute equally to an activity that generates $100,000 in income per
year. In this case a fair agreement would divide the profits equally with each party
making about $50,000. By contrast an unfair, but still win-win agreement would distribute
the benefits unequally with, perhaps, with one party receiving $90,000 and the other
$10,000. Such unfair treatment is likely to foster resentment between the parties and
could easily lead the unfairly treated party to withdraw, eliminating a mutually
beneficial arrangement. Such unfair treatment could even establish a hostile relationship
among parties who would otherwise have been partners. </big>
