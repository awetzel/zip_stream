<p>Negotiation is a social process in which training and experience significantly
increases effectiveness. This puts less experienced parties at a considerable disadvantage
when they negotiate with more experienced parties. The same is true when people with
different communication and negotiation styles come together. If one party is
self-confident, aggressive, and tends to dominate a conversation, while the second party
is insecure and quiet, the former is likely to dominate the negotiation process and so
achieve a better outcome. </p>

<p>Mediators recognize this bias, however, and often will try to counter-act its effect by
assisting the inexperienced or quiet party in a mediation more than he or she helps the
other party. (This is one aspect of what is called power-balancing or empowerment of the
lower power disputant.). This does not happen in direct negotiations, however (ones
without a mediator involved), and may not be sufficient in any case to completely
eliminate the effect of different negotiating styles or experience levels.</p>
