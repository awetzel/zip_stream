<p>Stereotypes are generalizations, or assumptions people make about the characteristics
of all members of a group, based on an image (often wrong) about what people in that group
are like. For example, one study of stereotypes reveal that Americans are generally
considered to be friendly, generous, and tolerant, but also arrogant, impatient, and
domineering. Asians, on the other hand, were expected to be shrewd and alert, but
reserved. Clearly, not all Americans are friendly and generous; and not all Asians are
shrewd. If you assume you know what a person is like, and don't look at each person as an
individual, you are likely to make errors in your estimates of a person's character. </p>

<p>In conflicts, people tend to develop overly-negative images of the other side. The
opponent is expected to be aggressive, self-serving, and deceitful, for example, while
people view themselves in completely positive ways. These stereotypes tend to be
self-perpetuating. If one side assumes the other side is deceitful and aggressive, they
will tend to respond in a similar way. The opponent will then develop a similar image of
the first party, and the negative stereotypes will be confirmed. They may be grow worse,
as communication is shut down and escalation heightens emotions and tension.</p>
