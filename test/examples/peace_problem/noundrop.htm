<p>This is a very common problem. People in conflict often assume that everyone sees the
situation the same way they, themselves, do. They fail to recognize that other people are
in different situations, and have different interests, needs, values, and experiences. For
these reasons, it is actually uncommon for people on both sides to define the problem in
the same way. </p>

<p>These different perceptions make good communication extremely important. However, good
communication is usually absent in conflict situations. People often cut off
communications with the other side, which limits the parties' ability to learn enough
about the opponents' view of the situation to make an effective response. Instead they
tend to act based on assumptions and stereotypes. When these are wrong, such actions are
likely to be ineffective (at best) and highly destructive or counter-productive (at
worst).</p>
