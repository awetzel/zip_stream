<h3>Considerable Work is Required to Use this Program Effectively</h3>

<p>As users will see, this training program contains an enormous amount of information.
&nbsp; While we have done as much as we can to present this information in a succinct and
usable way, it still takes a lot of effort to sort through this much information, find
exactly what you need, and then determine how to apply it effectively in your own
situation. Although some scholars have proposed a single approach to most or all conflict
problems, none of these approaches has worked well in the case of intractable conflicts,
which tend to be extremely complex and difficult to resolve. The incremental approach we
suggest here requires carefully identifying the nature of the problems that are causing
the conflict and the complicating factors, and then equally carefully analyzing
alternative approaches for dealing with the problems.&nbsp; The effectiveness of this
program will increase dramatically if users take the time to work through each part of the
program and carefully consider the degree to which the ideas presented applies to their
specific situation. </p>

<h3>Rational Theoretical Orientation</h3>

<p>The approach that we present is based upon rational scientific analysis and academic
inquiry. Although we have tried to incorporate ideas from authors who live outside the
U.S.&nbsp; and who may approach conflict in other ways, this is still the approach we are
most familiar and comfortable with, and the material on the web reflects this bias. We
hope over time that we can supplement this material with other approaches as well, as we
gain collaborators and contributors who may give alternative analyses and constructive
confrontation ideas.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We also urge our readers to examine this material critically--carefully considering
what works for them and what doesn't.&nbsp; When our description of a problem or a
solution does not seem to make sense, it is useful to consider what does--what do you do
that is different, but accomplishes the same goal.&nbsp; Or does the goal not make sense?
&nbsp;&nbsp; What goals do you have instead?&nbsp; Do they take you the same place? &nbsp;
Should they?&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Values</h3>

<p>The approach that we take the conflict is not value free. Our goal is the development
of strategies for dealing with conflict which&nbsp; advance the cause of justice as well
as peace. This means that we advocate strategies that will most effectively obtain each
side's legitimate interests and needs in the least costly and damaging way. &nbsp;
Generally, we assume, these strategies will be nonviolent (as violence is almost always
very costly and damaging), but we acknowledge that violence is sometimes the only way to
pursue justice.&nbsp; In any case, however, we do not argue for one particular
solution.&nbsp; Rather, we present a set of possible approaches to many different
problems, and rely on the users to chose the approach that best matches their own
interests and needs.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Difficult to Translate Words </h3>

<p>There are many important concepts used in this training program which, unfortunately,
can be difficult to explain and even more difficult to translate. To reduce the risk of
misunderstanding ,we often try to explain terms in several different ways. We ask readers
to go through all of the explanations to make sure that they understand what we mean.
&nbsp;You will find that some of our definitions are different that the definitions in
standard translation dictionaries. We do note this, however, when this occurs, so that
readers don't need to guess which terms are being used in a special, technical sense, and
which are not. Since these specialized words are central to our theory, they tend to
appear over and over again.&nbsp; We do not define them every time, but we do provide a
glossary which can be accessed if readers have a question about a term. </p>
