<h2>Information About Service Providers</h2>

<p>Mny users will be able to obtain access to the Internet through&nbsp; businesses,
universities, and government agencies with which they work,&nbsp; others will have more
trouble connecting to the Internet.&nbsp; In our experience we have found the Association
for Progressive Communication (APC) to be an excellent source of information on low-cost,
peace-related access to the Internet in countries around world.&nbsp; Go directly to the
APC <strong><a href="http://www.apc.org/">Web Site</a></strong> for more information.
&nbsp; This site contains information in both English and Spanish.&nbsp; Or, for an
English list of&nbsp; Internet access providers around world you can <strong><a href="http://www.apc.org/members.html">click here</a></strong> here for APC members, and <strong><a href="http://www.apc.org/partners.html">here</a></strong> for APC partners. </p>

<h2>Alternatives to Using the Program Online</h2>

<p>For people who have difficulty downloading the many small files associated with the
training program we are creating a variety of alternative options including: 

<ul>
  <li>Larger compressed files (one for each unit) which can be downloaded and installed on the
    user's own computer and browsed offline. </li>
  <li>These larger compressed files are also available on computer diskettes via regular mail.
    (There is a small charge for this service which may be waived in cases of financial need.)</li>
  <li>Printed versions of the materials at cost through regular mail. </li>
</ul>

<p>Contact the<strong> <a href="mailto:crcAcolorado.edu">Consortium</a></strong> for more
information on these options..</p>

<h2><strong>Formatting Problems </strong></h2>

<p>The format of &quot;.html&quot; pages on the world-wide-web is largely controlled by
the browser (your computer) and not the server (our computer). Specifically type size,
line length, and margins are controlled by the browser. This means that you can change
these things if you would like. In Netscape, for example, you can adjust the size of the
font (type size) in the &quot;view&quot; menu. You can also adjust the width of the page
you see on the screen by simply adjusting the size of the viewing window. You can adjust
the default font and type size under &quot;preferences&quot; in the &quot;edit&quot;
window.&nbsp; You can also adjust the way in which documents are printed with &quot;page
set-up&quot; under the &quot;file&quot; menu. These commands work for Netscape. &nbsp;
Similar commands are available for Microsoft Internet Explorer and other Web browsers.</p>

<p><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Reducing Connect Time
If the cost of maintaining a continuous connection to the World Wide Web presents a problem, we recommend that the following procedure for reducing connect time charges by approximately 80%. Click on and then save the following files to a convenient directory on your hard disk, then disconnect from the Internet. 
While offline, use your browser to open the first of these files. You can then surf the problem-identification component of the site as if you were online. Use your browser&#146;s bookmark feature to ---- any indepth documentation files that you would like. Now, log back on to the Internet and go through each of your bookmark files, and recall each of your bookmark files and save them to the hard disk. Disconnect from the Internet. At this point, you will have copies of the files that you can refer to in the future without having to log back on to the Internet. If, at a later time, you decide that there are additional files that you would like to retrieve, simply repeat the process Insert earlier. For people who would like to limit their connect time, click here. Download or print these instructions and disconnect from the Internet. " --></p>
