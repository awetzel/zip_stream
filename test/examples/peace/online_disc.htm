<h2>On-Line Discussions</h2>

<p>One of the goals for this online training program is the establishment of a mechanism
through which system users can engage in a global conversation about their ideas
concerning the advantages and disadvantages of alternative strategies for dealing with
specific conflict problems. &nbsp;Our goal is for participants to contribute real world
stories about the conflict problems that they have encountered, the strategies that they
have used in attempting to deal with these problems, and the results of these efforts. To
do this we have established a series of on-line discussion groups, one for each major
component of the training program.&nbsp; We encourage users to&nbsp; address topics such
as the following: 

<ul>
  <li>Descriptions of conflict problems encountered.</li>
  <li>User suggestions for limiting the problem,</li>
  <li>Descriptions of successful and unsuccessful treatment strategies related to this
    problem. </li>
  <li>General questions and suggestions for improving Consortium materials. </li>
  <li>General announcements </li>
</ul>

<p>When users log into the system they finds a table of contents in outline form with
links to contributed discussion items.&nbsp; To continue a discussion on a particular
topic all users have to do is go to the appropriate table of contents entry and follow the
directions for inserting comments. These comments can be written in the text editing
window provided or they can be cut and pasted from your word processor. You can also
include links to other web accessible documents such as those found on the On-line
Documents Page discussed below. The system also automatically enters a users e-mail
address so that someone interested in their comments can respond to them directly. You
will also note that it is very easy to start completely new discussion topics. </p>

<h2><b>List Server</b> </h2>

<p>Another on-line discussion tool is a simple list server. It can be thought of as a
community mailing list in which all members of the community can easily e-mail all other
members of the community. Two things make this different from the thousands of junk
mailing lists which plague our lives. First, participants make a conscious (and revocable)
decision to join the list because they want to receive the information it provides.
Second, participants agree to only send messages that are likely to interest list members.
Possible list serve messages include: publication announcements, conference announcements,
calls for papers, inquiries about job opportunities for graduating students, calls for
collaborators, requests for book recommendations, etc. <em><strong>When replying to a list
serve message, it is best to reply to the specific individual sending the message unless
it is felt that others are likely to be interested in the response</strong></em>.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Send the following message: <strong>subscribe conflict_training &lt;your

<hr>

<h2 align="left">Online Documents Page </h2>

<p align="left">Still another discussion tool is an online documents page on which
participants can post the following types of information: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Full-text, online accessible papers (or, even, books), </li>
  <li>Short summaries of articles and books along with information about how to obtain
    complete printed copies, </li>
  <li>Longer essays to be incorporated in the online discussion (see below), </li>
  <li>Graphic images, </li>
  <li>Raw data sets, </li>
  <li>Useful links to other web accessible resources, </li>
  <li>Conference announcements, </li>
  <li>Descriptions of ongoing research and proposed research projects, and </li>
  <li>Anything else that seems appropriate. </li>
</ul>

<p>You can also send us materials on a disk or as an e-mail attachment and we will post
it. If you do this, we request that you follow our <a href="guidelines.htm">Guidelines for
Web Contributors</a>. In addition, we would like a title and a short, two or three line
description of each item to be posted.</p>

<p>To go to this on-line documents page <a href="online_docs.htm">click here</a>. This
online documents&nbsp;page is set up in a way which allows full-text searching of the
online documents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click here for this service.&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><em><strong>To
be added.</strong></em></font></p>

<h2>Links Page</h2>

<p>If you have one or more web links that are likely to be of interest to training program
users you can send them to us in an <a href="mailto:crc@colorado.edu">e-mail message</a>.
&nbsp; Each link should have a short title and a two line description.&nbsp; You can also
post links to the links section of the discussion group.</p>
