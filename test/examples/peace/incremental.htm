<p>A fifth important distinction is one between relatively simple systems that are fully
understood and open to manipulation, and complex, natural systems that are only partially
understood and manipulatable. Many conflict professionals see conflicts as relatively
simple situations which can be completely assessed, analyzed, understood, altered, and
hence, &quot;fixed.&quot; For example, many conflict consultants engage in what is called
&quot;dispute systems design.&quot; They look at a &quot;dispute system&quot;--a family, a
school, or a business, for instance, and learn what conflicts arise repeatedly and what
causes these conflicts. They then design a new way for dealing with these problems. The
new approach will either avoid the conflicts in the first place, or resolve them
efficiently when they do occur. </p>

<p>Dispute systems design is very effective when the system under examination is
relatively simple, predictable, and controllable. In these situations, the same people (or
types of people) are involved in the same kinds of conflicts over and over again. In
addition, the assumption is made that people can be controlled. A manager can tell
employees what to do, and the assumption is made that they will do it. A parent can tell
the children how the family will be run, and the assumption is made that the children will
agree. This approach views conflict producing systems--families, schools, or businesses
much like machines. They break, but the problems can be clearly identified and fixed. </p>

<p>Resolution resistant conflicts often do not fit this simple, predictable, and
remediable model. They tend to be complex, and highly volatile. While one can identify
most of the parties, issues, interests, and positions, these and other conflict
characteristics are often changing. So too are the conflict dynamics. The end result is a
system that can only be understood and dealt with bit-by-bit, not as a unified whole.
Rather than trying to design a solution that will &quot;fix&quot; or &quot;resolve&quot;
the entire conflict, a more effective approach is to identify particular dynamics that are
causing problems and fixing those. This will not resolve the entire conflict, but it will
probably make it more constructive. Therefore, unlike many conflict specialists who try to
use one particular technique, for instance negotiation, mediation, or analytical problem
solving, to resolve intractable conflicts, our approach seeks to identify the incremental
changes that can be made in the way the conflict is being handled that may make the
outcome more beneficial. Often these incremental changes can be made by one side acting
alone. At other times, they require all the parties to cooperate, either on their own, or
with the assistance of a third party intermediary.</p>
