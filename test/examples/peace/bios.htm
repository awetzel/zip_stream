<h3><strong>Paul Wehr</strong></h3>

cooperative resolution of conflict. His published works include <em>Peace and<br>
World Order Systems</em> (Sage, 1976), <em>Conflict Regulation</em> (Westview, 1979), I<em>n
Response to Aggression</em> (Pergamon, 1981), <em>Conflict Regulation</em> (Westview,
