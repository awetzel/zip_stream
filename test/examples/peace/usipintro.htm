<hr>

<p>This program can be used in a variety of ways. It can be searched quickly to find a
solution to a particular problem. Or it can be studied in some detail--to learn more about
resolution-resistant conflicts in general and how they can be most effectively approached.
The program can be used by itself by people who have little or no experience in conflict
management. It can also be used, however, to supplement other conflict management training
or reading. Since we take a somewhat different approach to conflict management and
resolution than is common among our colleagues, the material on this website is likely to
give users a new perspective and additional ideas about how best to confront difficult
conflict situations. <br WP="BR1">

<p>Constructive Confrontation: A New Theoretical Approach</strong> <br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>The approach we take to deal with difficult and resolution-resistant conflicts, which
we call constructive confrontation, draws ideas from several fields. It draws heavily from
the new fields of conflict resolution and peace research, utilizing the wisdom of <INS>practitioners
</INS>as well as scholars. It also draws ideas from experts in <INS>advocacy, community organization</INS>,
and <INS>nonviolent direct action</INS>. Unlike those who seek resolution for the sake of resolution,
we seek justice, fairness, good decisions, and good solutions. Sometimes this means
working to resolve a conflict, while sometimes it means continuing the conflict, but doing
so in a more constructive way.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>We make a number of theoretical assumptions which guide our approach to resolution
resistant conflicts. These include several key distinctions, which are discussed below.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p><strong>Fundamental Distinctions</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>1. Short-Term and Long-Term Conflicts <br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Many conflict scholars make a distinction between short-term conflicts that can be
relatively easily resolved (often called &quot;disputes&quot;), and long-term conflicts
that involve non-negotiable issues that tend to resist resolution. Typically, short-term
conflicts or disputes involve interests that are negotiable. That means that it is
possible to find a solution that meets each side's interests and needs--at least
partially. For example, it generally is possible to find an agreeable price for a piece of
merchandise. The seller may want more, the buyer may want to pay less, but they usually
can agree on a price which is acceptable to both. Likewise, co-workers may disagree about
who is to do what task in an office. After negotation, each may have to do something they
did not want to do, but in exchange they will get enough of what they did want to settle
the dispute.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Long-term conflicts, on the other hand, usually involve non-negotiable issues. They may
involve deep-rooted value differences, high-stakes distributional questions, or conflicts
about who dominates whom. Fundamental needs for identity, security, and recognition are
often at issue as well. None of these issues are negotiable--people will not compromise
fundamental values, nor will they give up their chance for a better life by submitting to
continued injustice or domination, nor will they change or give up their self-identity.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>While many disputes stand alone and are really settled permanently, others are part of
a continuing long-term conflict. For example, each round of Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the U.S.-Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan--as long as some of these were, were all short-term conflicts or
&quot;disputes&quot; in the context of the Cold War--which was a long-term conflict.
However, as that example illustrates, even the most resolution-resistant conflicts can be
transformed and resolved. While the U.S. and Russia are not &quot;best friends,&quot;
their relationship is certainly much more positive now that it was during the Cold War,
and expectations for a U.S.-Russian war are much more remote.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>While this training program is useful for all kinds of conflicts and disputes, it is
primarily designed to help people better deal with highly resolution-resistant conflicts.
While we will touch lightly on techniques for resolving simpler disputes, our emphasis
will be on the management, or what we call &quot;constructive confrontation&quot; of
intractable or resolution-resistant conflicts. </p>

<p>***INSERT CONFLICT/DISPUTE DIAGRAM FOR DUFOUNTAIN HERE***</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>This figure illustrates the relationship between an imaginary dispute between two
ethnic groups in a post-colonial society named Dufountain. The two groups in this
hypothetical country as the &quot;Duists&quot; and the &quot;Fountists.&quot; Time runs
from left to right. Each of the sets of fat arrows represents one short-term conflict, or
as the chart calls it, a &quot;dispute.&quot; In this illustration, eight disputes occur.
The first two result in improved policies for the Duists (show by the solid black arrows
going up toward the top of the page). The next two do not change the relative situations
for either group (thus the black arrows go straight across the page). Then disputes five,
six, and seven result in outcomes that are less favorable to the Duists, but more
favorable to the Fountists. None of the disputes resolves the long-term, underlying
conflict; the dispute settlements only alter social policies <em>for a time</em> in a way
that favors one group more than another. Whenever the losing group believes that it has
gained enough power to prevail in a later dispute, it will most likely try again to engage
the opponent and force an outcome that is more favorable to them than the dispute outcome
was. For this reason, dispute settlement is not the same thing as conflict resolution. One
is a temporary settlement of an immediate problem; the other is a long-term settlement of
an underlying long-running conflict.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>While this training program is useful for all kinds of conflicts and disputes, it is
primarily designed to help people better deal with highly resolution resistant conflicts.
Thus, while we will touch lightly on techniques for resolving simpler disputes, our
emphasis will be on the management, or what we call &quot;constructive confrontation: of
intractable or resolution-resistant conflicts.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>For more information on the differences between short term disputes and long term
conflicts, see Burton, 1990 and Burton and Dukes, 1990.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>2. Tractable and Intractable (Resolution-Resistant) Conflicts</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Conflicts can be ranked according to their ease of settlement or resolution. Simple
disputes involving only two people and relatively minor issues can usually be settled very
quickly. Other conflicts strongly resist resolution. These tend to be ones based on
deep-rooted value differences (for example differences in religious beliefs), conflicts
involving high stakes distributional questions (for example, territorial conflicts between
nations) and conflicts over a person's or group's placement in the social, economic, and
political hierarchy (discrimination against an ethnic group), for example. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>All of these situations are characterized by a problem that cannot be resolved in a
win-win way. If one value system is followed, another is threatened. If one nation
controls a piece of land, another does not. If one group is dominant, another is
subordinate. While sharing is possible in theory, contending sides usually see a shared
solution as a loss, as they do not have total control. This is especially true in
societies where natural fear and hatred is so ingrained that opposing groups cannot
imagine living with or working cooperatively with the other side.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Such unavoidable win-lose outcomes, together with the high perceived importance of the
issue, tends to result in very resolution-resistant conflicts. Other factors which make
conflicts more difficult to resolve include numbers of people (or groups) involved,
numbers of issues, the complexity of the issues, and a previous history of destructive and
violent confrontation. Even relatively simple disputes, when badly handled, can escalate
into very destructive and intractable conflicts. Thus effective dispute settlement and
conflict management is important for all kinds of conflicts.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Although intractable conflicts resist resolution, they are not absolutely impossible to
resolve. At times, intractable conflicts are transformed into disputes which can be
resolved. This often occurs after a prolonged standoff when neither side can prevail, yet
both are being greatly harmed by continuing the conflict. Once both sides realize this is
occurring, they are often more willing to negotiate a solution than they had been before.
(The end of Apartheid in South Africa is one example of a very intractable conflict that
was transformed in the 1990s with the implementation of the South African National Peace
Accord.)</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Although this website is helpful in the management and resolution tractable conflicts,
it is primarily designed to be used to help people learn more about intractable conflicts
and how they can be dealt with most effectively. Often that does not mean seeking
resolution, but rather managing the conflict or confronting the conflict in a constructive
way. Here the emphasis is not on ending the conflict, but it carrying it out in a way that
brings more benefits to the disputants than it brings costs.</p>

</p>

<p>3. Conflict Management, Settlement, and Resolution</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Just as conflict scholars often distinguish between short-term conflicts (or disputes)
and long term conflicts, many also distinguish between &quot;dispute settlement,&quot;
&quot;conflict management,&quot; and &quot;conflict resolution.&quot; Disputes are usually
settled permanently by working out a mutually-satisfactory agreement through negotiation
or mediation, or by adjudication in which an expert (a judge, a jury, or an arbitrator)
decides that one side was right, and the other was wrong. In both situations, the dispute
is settled--that is, it is ended. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>When long-term conflicts are ended, scholars say they are &quot;resolved.&quot; By this
they mean that a relatively stable solution has been found by identifying and dealing with
the underlying sources of the confict. This is more difficult to do than simple
&quot;dispute settlement,&quot; because resolution means going beyond negotiating
interests to meeting all sides' basic needs, and finding a way to respect their underlying
values and identity. This often requires making significant socio-economic or political
changes that restructure society in a more just or inclusive way.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>&quot;Conflict management&quot; involves the control, but not resolution, of a
long-term or deep-rooted conflict. This is the approach of choice when complete resolution
seems to be impossible. In this case, a conflict can be managed to make it more
constructive and less destructive--thus making the results of the ongoing conflict more
beneficial and less damaging to all sides. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>For more information on the distinction between these terms, see Burton and Dukes,
1990.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>4. Core Conflict and Complicating Factors</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>We find it useful to distinguish between two parts of a conflict: the core conflict and
the complicating factors. The core conflict involves the basic things that the conflict is
about --the incompatible interests, the unmet needs, the fundamental value differences, or
the struggle for justice. The complicating factors are the extra issues and problems that
occur as the conflict goes on that makes dealing with the core conflict more difficult.
These include problems with conflict definition (disagreements about what the conflict is
really about); misunderstandings, fact-finding problems, decision making procedural
problems, and escalation. Each of these complicating factors tends to intensify or obscure
the core conflict, making it harder to deal with effectively. Even when the core conflict
is highly resistant to resolution, by limiting (or even eliminating) most of the
complicating factors it is possible to deal with the remaining conflict in a much more
constructive way. For this reason, our approach focuses on defining the conflict in terms
of core and complicating factors, and then considering what incremental changes can be
made in each to make the conflict more constructive.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

conflict and complicating factors.</p>

</p>

<p>**INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE!***</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the core conflict and the complicating
factors. The code conflict is shown in the center. Over that lie two layers of
complicating factors. The first is conflict definition problems. (This is sometimes
referred to as &quot;framing&quot; problems as people define a conflict by putting a
&quot;frame&quot; around a particular part of it, thereby focusing on that part.) The way
the disputants define it as a relatively simple difference of interests or a
misunderstanding, they will probably be able to deal with it relatively easily. If they
define it as a fundamental moral disagreement, or an issue of justice, or personal
identity or pride, it is likely to be more difficult to resolve. Similarly, conflicts that
are defined as negotiable probably will be, while conflicts that are seen to involve
non-negotiable needs or values may be considerably more difficult to resolve.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>The outer layer then contains four other complicating factors. These are the ones
listed above: misunderstandings, fact-finding problems, procedural problems, and
escalation. On the top circle, these complicating factors are unlimited--in other words,
they are not being controlled. When complicating factors are allowed to build up, they can
become so &quot;thick&quot; that they completely obscure the core conflict. In the lower
circle, the complicating factors have been controlled, though they have not been
eliminated. Nevertheless, the complicating factors are much less overwhelming, and it is
much easier to see through them down to the core. A significant part of constructive
confrontation involves methods of identifying complicating factors, and implementing
techniques to limit these factors, so that attention can be better focused on the core
issues.</p>

&quot;overlay&quot; factors, see Burgess and Burgess, 1996.</p>

</p>

<p>5. Design-and-Control Systems and Complex, Natural Systems</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>A fifth important distinction is one between relatively simple systems that are fully
understood and open to manipulation, and complex, natural systems that are only partially
understood and manipulatable. Many conflict professionals see conflicts as relatively
simple situations which can be completely assessed, analyzed, understood, altered, and
hence, &quot;fixed.&quot; For example, many conflict consultants engage in what is called
&quot;dispute systems design.&quot; They look at a &quot;dispute system&quot;--a family, a
school, or a business, for instance, and learn what conflicts arise repeatedly and what
causes these conflicts. They then design a new way for dealing with these problems. The
new approach will either avoid the conflicts in the first place, or resolve them
efficiently when they do occur. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Dispute systems design is very effective when the system under examination is
relatively simple, predictable, and controllable. In these situations, the same people (or
types of people) are involved in the same kinds of conflicts over and over again. In
addition, the assumption is made that people can be controlled. A manager can tell
employees what to do, and the assumption is made that they will do it. A parent can tell
the children how the family will be run, and the assumption is made that the children will
agree. This approach views conflict producing systems--families, schools, or businesses
much like machines. They break, but the problems can be clearly identified and fixed. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Resolution resistant conflicts often do not fit this simple, predictable, and
remediable model. They tend to be complex, and highly volatile. While one can identify
most of the parties, issues, interests, and positions, these and other conflict
characteristics are often changing. So too are the conflict dynamics. The end result is a
system that can only be understood and dealt with bit-by-bit, not as a unified whole.
Rather than trying to design a solution that will &quot;fix&quot; or &quot;resolve&quot;
the entire conflict, a more effective approach is to identify particular dynamics that are
causing problems and fixing those. This will not resolve the entire conflict, but it will
probably make it more constructive. Therefore, unlike many conflict specialists who try to
use one particular technique, for instance negotiation, mediation, or analytical problem
solving, to resolve intractable conflicts, our approach seeks to identify the incremental
changes that can be made in the way the conflict is being handled that may make the
outcome more beneficial. Often these incremental changes can be made by one side acting
alone. At other times, they require all the parties to cooperate, either on their own, or
with the assistance of a third party intermediary.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Constructive Confrontation</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>These ideas have led us to propose a general approach for the analysis and management
of resolution-resistant conflicts which we call &quot;constructive confrontation.&quot;
This term reflects the fact that most resolution-resistant conflicts cannot be resolved
permanently, but rather will continue to be confronted by the parties over time. This
confrontation, however, does not necd to be as destructive and counter-productive as it
often is. By examining the conflict elements and dynamics, parties and intermediaries can
develop a deeper understanding of the nature of the core conflict and the associated
complicating factors. Efforts can then be made to limit or even eliminate the complicating
factors, so that the core elements of the conflict can be addressed in the most effective
way possible. The result is a much more constructive approach to the continuing conflict
which can lead to individual and group empowerment, mutual recognition of all of the
parties' views and development of a process for dealing with specific disputes within the
long-running conflict which is perceived to be fair and effective.</p>

<p>Constructive confrontation is also different from many other approaches to
resolution-resistant conflict because it can be used by the parties themselves without
outside assistance, or even by one of the parties acting alone. More progress can be made,
to be sure, if both parties take this approach to a conflict, but since the approach is
incremental, a change on one side can also have a significant effect, and may actually
prompt a change on the part of the other people or group(s). We often point out that
conflict is something people do themselves all the time. Few people wait for a mediator to
figure out how to handle their conflicts. They do not have the time; nor, often, do they
have the money if outside professionals must be brought in. People in conflict must learn
how to handle their conflicts effectively on their own. Constructive confrontation is an
approach which is designed to be used by people who want to understand their own
situations better, and develop approaches to those situations that will work effectively,
even if they do not have a mediator or other intermediary to help them.</p>

<p>The Role of Power in Constructive Confrontation</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Many conflict resolution specialists try to resolve conflicts with negotiation,
mediaiton, or other consensus-based techniques which they see as an alternative to power
or force-based approaches to resolution. Often it is said that in mediation, the parties
&quot;leave power at the door.&quot; We believe that this is a misconception. Mediation is
one of many alternative approaches to conflict--all of which involve power in one or more
forms. Parties involved in mediation do no &quot;leave their power at the door&quot;,
rather, they bring it to the table and try to use it to influence the mediated outcome.
For this reason, an understanding of what power is, how it is obtained, and how it can be
used is of great importance.</p>

<p>Using Constructive Confrontation</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>Constructive Confrontation involves four steps: 1) conflict assessment; 2)solution
identification and selection; 3) implementation, and 4) solution evaluation and revision</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>1) Conflict Assessment</p>

<p>Conflict assessment involves the identification of what the conflict is about, who is
involved, why they are involved, and what complicating factors are making the situation
especially difficult to deal with effectively. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>People who routinely deal with conflicts--lawyers, mediators, and diplomats, for
instance, always do a conflict assessment before they decide how to approach a problem.
They try to understand as much as they can about what is going on and who is involved so
that they can plan and then carry out an appropriate response.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>People who are involved in a conflict themselves often overlook the importance of doing
a conflict assessment. They assume that they know what is going on, who is involved and
why, and what they should do about it. When conflicts are simple--when they involve only
two people and one or two issues, for example--a conflict assessment may not be important.
</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>But when conflicts are complex --involving many people, many issues, perhaps having a
long history and strong emotions, it is very helpful to conduct a conflict assessment
before deciding how to respond. If you are being helped by a conflict professional (a
lawyer or mediator, for instance) they can help you do the conflict assessment, or may do
it for you. If you are acting on your own, however, you should do your own conflict
assessment before making choices about appropriate ways to address specific opponents or
issues, or how to handle the conflict over the long term.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>HOW TO DO A CONFLICT ASSESSMENT: Many conflict assessment guides are available. Most
often, they consist of lists of questions to answer or things to consider before dealing
with a conflict. Although the lists differ in details, most contain many similar elements.
These include questions about who is involved, what they want (or need) that they do not
have, and how they are trying to get their needs or desires met.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>This website is, in itself, a detailed conflict assessment tool. By working through the
website and answering the questions it asks, you will get a detailed understanding of the
conflicts you are involved in, including the nature of the core conflict and the
complicating factors or problems that are making the conflict more difficult to handle.
Once you understand this you can move on to the identification and selection of solutions
for particular problems. If you want a shorter, simpler conflict assessment tool, several
are available. (See below.)</p>

</p>

<p>2. Identification and Selection of Solutions to Problems</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>After the conflict assessment is completed, disputants (and third parties) should have
a better understanding of the problems they are facing. If the conflict appears to be
negotiable, and if the parties are ready to sit down and negotiate, settlement is usually
relatively simple to obtain.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>In long-lasting, intense, and complex conflicts, however, obtaining even a short-term
settlement can be very difficult. Often, the best that can be done is to deal with
individual problems within the context of the larger conflict. For instance, if
misunderstandings are a problem, efforts can be made to improve communication between the
parties. If procedural issues are in dispute, procedures can be changed to make them more
open and fair. While incremental solutions to particular problems will not fairly resolve
the conflict, they can make it more manageable and more constructive. They will help limit
the complicating factors, allowing the parties to focus more of their attention on the
core aspects of the conflict and do so in a way that is more likely to advance their
interests than they could when complicating factors distorted the situation.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>3. Implementation of Solutions</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>The third step in constructive confrontation is the implementation of the solutions
chosen in step two to limit complicating factors and to increase the effectiveness of the
confrontation over the core issues. Since resolution-resistant conflicts are usually
complex and involve a number of different complicating factors, a choice must be made
about timing of the solution steps. One problem can be taken at a time, or several can be
dealt with at once. The optimal approach will be different in each case. For this reason
parties must look at the security of the problems and the availability of solutions to
make a judgment about what to do when.</p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>4. Evaluation and revision </p>

<p>Resolution-resistant conflicts are often so complex that it is impossible to predict
what the outcome of any particular action might be. Solutions that are expected remedy a
problem may do so, or they might not. They also might create unexpected problems in other
areas. For this reason, it is critical that parties carefully evaluate the results of all
of their actions, and revise their conflict strategies as needed in an effort to make the
confrontation as constructive as possible.</p>

<h1><a NAME="_1_1"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>The section that follows lists common conflict problems with a short description of
each. Below each problem are several options. You may 1) ask to see a more detailed
description of the problem; 2) ask to see some examples of the problem in actual
situations; 3) ask to read about possible solutions to this problem, or 4) ask to read
about closely related problems. You will get a similar list of choices if you go to the
solution list for a particular problem. In this case you will see a list of possible
solutions to the problem you were interested in with a two sentence description of each.
You may then 1) ask to see a more detailed description of one (or more) of these
solutions; 2) ask to read about how this solution has been implemented in an actual
conflict situation; 3) see a list of other problems that this solution helps deal with. </p>

<p>There are many ways to use this resource. You may skip around from link to link reading
only those topics that are of direct interest to you or relevance to your immediate
situation. This enables you to &quot;customize&quot; the information you receive to match
your specific situation. Or you may go straight through, reading most or all of the
information on all of the entries. While this takes much longer, it gives a much better
overview of the nature of intractable conflicts in general and how they can be approached
in more constructive ways. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>To simplify programing, it is necessary to go back to the main problem list to move
from one option to another--for example if you want to read more information about a
problem and then see some examples of the problem and then read about solutions, you need
to use the &quot;go back&quot; arrow on your browser to go back to the problem list to
click on the next item you wish to read.</p>

</p>

<p>The problems in this problem list are divided into four parts. These are shown in
Figure 4. The first part involves problem definition--defining what the conflict is about
(framing), who is involved, and what the context of the conflict is (scoping). Without an
accurate understanding of the people and/or issues involved and how the conflict relates
to other situations (past and present) it is very hard to confront any conflict in an
effective way. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>The second part involves confrontation strategies. People involved in conflicts can do
one of two things. They can withdraw from the conflict, or they can confront it in some
way. When they confront it, they are trying to influence the situation in a way which will
benefit themselves. They may do so in a variety of ways--they may use force, they may try
to negotiate, or they may try to persuade the opponent to change his or her attitudes
and/or behavior. This looks at problems that arise regarding how the conflict is being
confronted. </p>

<p><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</p>

<p>The third part looks at complicating factors that often make conflicts worse than they
really should be and make them difficult to handle constructively, even if one takes care
of all of the problems discussed earlier. Typical complicating factors include
communication problems, fact-finding problems, and escalation.</p>
