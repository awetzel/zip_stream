<h3><a href="essay/con_conf.htm"><strong>Constructive Confrontation Theoretical Framework</strong></a></h3>

<p>This paper gives explains the how intractable conflicts are different from simpler
disputes, and what factors tend to contribute to a conflict's intractability.&nbsp; It
also explains how we approach the management of intractable conflicts and why this
approach is likely to work better than alternative approaches which are designed to deal
with more tractable disputes. The paper also explains why the rest of the system (the
problem lists and solution lists) are organized as they are.</p>

<h3><a name="theory_essays"></a>Important Theoretical Distinctions</h3>

<p>We make a number of theoretical assumptions which guide our approach to intractable or
resolution resistant conflicts. These include several key distinctions, which are
discussed in the essays below.

    Conflicts</a></strong></li>

  <li><a href="win-lose.htm"><strong>Winning and Losing</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Other Assumptions that Have Guided Our Approach to Program Development</strong></h3>

<p>Our approach to dealing with intractable conflicts differs from common practice in a
number of other ways as well.&nbsp; We advocate an incremental&nbsp; approach which will
be different for every conflict--rather than a standard approach which supposedly will
work on all problems.&nbsp; We also focus as much, if not more, on actions the disputants
can take themselves without third party intervention or assistance.&nbsp; At the same
time, we recognize that third parties can facilitate this process, and we talk about ways
third parties can encourage the disputants to engage in more constructive confrontation
practices.&nbsp; Finally, we are trying an experiment to disseminate this information
electronically, instead of relying on more traditional print- or face-to-face based
training. As the world wide web does become more world wide, it is our hope that we will
be able to reach a much larger number of people this way.&nbsp; For more information about
some of these differences, see the essays below.

    Conflict Knowledge by Paul Wehr</a></strong></font></dt>
  <dd>This paper puts our work in context by showing how conflict resolution knowledge has
    grown and developed over the last 100 years.&nbsp; This paper explains the concept of a
    &quot;conflict knowledge base,&quot; and shows how the material we present here is drawn
    from a long history of knowledge development.</dd>
