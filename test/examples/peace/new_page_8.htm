<p>Faced with a difficult conflict, disputants sometimes overlook the possibility of using
negotiation or persuasion to improve the situation, relying instead on force. This is
especially likely to occur when force has already been used by the other side. In this
case, the most common reaction is to respond with equal to or even greater force. However,
this type of response is likely to escalate the situation, while other options might
protect your interests just as well, without making matters worse.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Link:

<p><strong>The Dismal Theorem of Forcing Power</strong></p>

<p>Conflicts are resolved in ways which tend to favor the most powerful. Here power is
determined by what people have to trade, what types of force they are able to use, and the
degree to which their goals are viewed as legitimate. There are, unfortunately, cases in
which unjustly treated groups may lack the power that they need to correct the situation.
They may not have items to trade in exchange relationships and they may not have the
ability to force others to address their grievances. They may also lack legitimacy because
they belong to minority groups which are discriminated against by the larger society. This
is especially likely to occur in cases where the parties have competing and contradictory
moral beliefs and the minority group refuses to recognize the wisdom of the majority's
moral principles. The result may be that there is no short-term remedy for the injustice
is being suffered by these groups. </p>

<p>Often disputants respond to force-based threats with counter-threats rather than
submission. Such threats and counter threats can result in intense efforts by both parties
to increase their ability to use force against each other. In military situations, this is
called an &quot;arms race.&quot; Similar dynamics can arise with legal, political, or
other types of force as well. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link:GRIT Generalized De-escalation; Alternate Forms of Force; Collective Security. Example Links: 6030;6160" -->more detailed description, including information on Legal Force. Political

<p>The cost of using force-based threats increases dramatically when the opponent responds
to a threat with defiance rather than submission. This forces the threatening party to
carry out the threat or admit that it was all a bluff. Carrying out a threat is likely to
result in an expensive, destructive, and rapidly escalating confrontation, while
withdrawing the threat is likely to undermine a party's ability to use threat and
force-based strategies in the future.<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Solution Link: INSERT. Example Link: 6030; Perry*; Aspen R.*, 7306,6314" --> <em>For

<p>Sometimes, when one makes a threat, the target challenges the threatening party to go
ahead and carry out the threat. This is much more difficult, expensive, and risky than
simply making the threat in the first place. However, if you do not follow through on the
threat, you will have lost a great deal of credibility. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="

<p>People or groups who use forced-based strategies often assume that their opponents will
quickly submit to their demands thereby providing a quick route to victory. While force
may succeed over the short term, it often generates a powerful backlash or retaliation, as
people hate to be forced to do things against their will. This is especially true when
victims of force believe that the use of force was illegitimate. In this situations, the
losing party is likely to try to build up their own forcing power in hopes of challenging
the victor at the earliest possible opportunity. The result is likely to be a long-term
intensification of the conflict, rather than resolution.&nbsp; closely related problems. <em>For

<p>Disputants often take the worst possible view of their opponents' intentions and
strategies. They may assume, for instance, that their opponent will quickly turn to
violence or other form of force, and thus they feel they must be prepared to resist, no
matter what happens. This often leads disputants to take more forceful actions of their
own. Opponents are, however, likely to interpret these actions as unnecessarily
aggressive, and use them to justify their own worst-case planning. In addition, disputants
sometimes assume that all of their opponents approach the conflict in the same way. If one
group of extremists, for example, gets a lot of coverage in the press, it is often assumed
that all of one's opponents are equally extreme. Usually, however, there is a great deal
of variation in the motivations of a group of advocates. A failure to employ different
strategies for individuals with different characteristics is likely to significantly
reduce one's effectiveness. <!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW=" Solution Links:Communication Improvement Strategies; Dialogue; Power Strategy Mix Example Links:6569, 6030, 6571." --> <em>For more information about this problem <a href="problem/worstop.htm">click here </a>or
