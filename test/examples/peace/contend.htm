<p>As a conflict emerges, the relationships of contending parties with one another take on
a special character. Attention comes to focus ever more on the behavior of the adversary
to the exclusion of any non-contenders involved. One justifies one's behavior increasingly
by what the other has done rather than by any universal standard of correct behavior. A
process Coleman (1957) has called reciprocal causation takes over so that the contenders
come to form something like an independent social unit engrossed in tit-for-tat attack and
defense behavior. Without some external intervention, such dynamics can lead to extreme
force being used at higher and higher cost. </p>
