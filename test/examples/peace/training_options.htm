<h2>University Credit</h2>

<p><strong><a href="course.htm">Shortcut to class units and assignments.</a></strong></p>

<p>There are two options for those wishing formal university credit&nbsp; for taking the
online training program. First option is to take the course for formal credit from the
University of Colorado as a variation of its online course -- Sociology 4025 (for detailed
information about this course <a href="course.htm">click here</a>). Alternatively, one can
take our more conventional, textbook oriented version of the Sociology 4025 course (for
detailed information about this more traditional course <a
href="http://www.Colorado.EDU/cewww/socy4025/">click here</a>). In either case, students
complete the assignments that are equivalent to a three-semester hour, senior level,
undergraduate course. Students pay the standard university tuition of $240 plus books for
the regular correspondence class. Students then receive instructor evaluation and advice
and a formal grade from the University of Colorado which can be applied toward degree
programs at many other universities. <font color="#800000"><strong><em>Students should
contact their own university to see if credits earned through this program are acceptable.
</em></strong></font></p>

<h2>Certification</h2>

<p><strong><a href="course.htm">Shortcut to class units and assignments.</a></strong></p>

<p>Recognizing that this may be prohibitively expensive and that many users do not need
expensive, formal university credit, we offer a second option--a Consortium Certificate of
Completion. For this option, students still submit papers which are evaluated by
Consortium instructors. However, instead of receiving University credit, they receive a
certificate issued by the Conflict Research Consortium indicating that they have completed
the training program. Accompanying this certificate is a letter from the Consortium
describing the materials covered and the work done. Also available is a certificate
indicating that the program was completed with distinction for participants who do
exceptional work. The cost for this service is only $100 for those who can afford to pay.
We recognize that even this small fee may pose a significant hardship for some students.
Therefore, we have established a &quot;scholarship&quot; fund to cover the cost of people
who might have difficulty paying. Users should not feel reluctant to take advantage of
this opportunity. The current structure of the global economy has created enormous income
differences and this program presents our very modest effort to correct for this
inequality. While our goal is to provide as many scholarships as needed, our ability to do
so continually depends upon our ability to raise the needed funds. If these funds are not
forthcoming, the program may have to be limited in some way. We hope that we won't have to
do this. To sign up for this certificate program simply send us an <a
href="mailto:crc@colorado.edu">e-mail message</a> with your name, organizational
affiliation (if appropriate), mailing address, and telephone and fax numbers. &nbsp; We
would also appreciate learning about your background and specific areas of interest.
&nbsp; If you are applying for a &quot;scholarship&quot; it would be helpful if you would
include a brief statement of your financial situation.&nbsp; This will help us secure the
funding needed to maintain the scholarship fund.</p>

<h2>No-Cost, Self Study</h2>

<p>For users who do not need formal certification, the training program and all of its
contents are available for free. Go to the <a href="online_consulting.htm">online
