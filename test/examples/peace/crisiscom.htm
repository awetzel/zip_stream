<p><font SIZE="+2">In crisis situations, the pace of the conflict accelerates
dramatically. This means that the parties have to react very quickly to changing
conditions or risk having their ability to protect their interests substantially reduced.
Crises&nbsp; are likely to be further complicated by the increased levels of fear, anger,
and hostility which are likely to be present.&nbsp; Often in crises, communication gets
distorted or cut off entirely.&nbsp; As a result, rumors often supplant real facts, and
worst-case assumptions drive the escalation spiral.&nbsp; In addition, parties often try
to keep their real interests, strategies, and tactics secret, and use deceptive strategies
to try to increase their relative power.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">In these difficult situations, the parties' ability to make rapid and
sound decisions is largely dependent on their ability to quickly obtain reliable
information. Thus, communication needs to be increased during crises, not cut off. &nbsp;
To prevent uncontrolled escalation, disputants must be able to effectively communicate
with adversaries, intermediaries, and other parties effectively, even under urgent and
highly emotional conditions. In the most serious situations, crisis communication involves
efforts to prevent or halt violent confrontations. &nbsp; &quot;Hotlines,&quot; rumor
control teams, and crisis control centers all offer related approaches for dealing with
this problem.</font></p>

    <dd>One of the advantages of the current rapid communication technologies is that it enables
      people to exchange information much faster and more accurately in times of crisis. &nbsp;
      (This, however, can be a detriment as well, as people have less time to &quot;cool
      down&quot; between hostile exchanges.)</dd>
