<p>This program is not intended to replace other forms of conflict management training.
&nbsp; Rather it is intended to supplement other training programs and provide training
and consulting to people who cannot get it in other ways.&nbsp; Although online training
has some clear disadvantages when compared to face-to-face training (loss of interpersonal
interaction is the most important), it also has some advantages that face to face training
lacks.&nbsp; This system is always available; it is far less expensive than face to face
training (and can be used for free if credit is not desired), and it provides more
information about theory and alternative approaches to problems than most other training
programs do. In addition, it provides the opportunity to exchange ideas and approaches
with people around the world.&nbsp; Although it will take some time to implement, we hope
to link users together in discussions which will span the globe.&nbsp; If you are
interested in participating in such a discussion, please let us know by clicking on our
e-mail address at the bottom of this page.&nbsp; As soon as we have enough responses to
set up a discussion, we will get one going.&nbsp; </p>
