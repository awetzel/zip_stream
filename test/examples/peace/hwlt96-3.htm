<h2>COLLECT IDEAS ON MORE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACHES TO INTRACTABLE CONFLICT</h2>

<p>Throughout its history the Consortium has tried to link the experience of conflict
professionals and disputants with the theoretical knowledge of conflict scholars. This
effort has led us to develop and continuously expand our organizational knowledge base. </p>

<p>The concept of an organizational knowledge base is a bit unusual. The traditional
research model suggests that researchers need only understand a field's knowledge base
sufficiently to identify an area of the frontier in which they would like to work. At this
point researchers tend to become specialists, developing projects which push back that
frontier by making incremental additions to a field's overall base of knowledge. This
approach has produced a world dominated by specialists. While this specialization is
responsible for the rapid advances in many fields, it is not a particularly good model for
solving complex, real-world problems. For that, we believe generalists are
needed&#151;researchers and programs devoted to bringing a field's entire, multi
disciplinary body of knowledge to bear on specific situations.</p>

<p>The Consortium is trying to be such an organization. Our goal is to use the
University's research and information management skills to provide people with
state-of-the-art information on the full range of strategies for dealing with intractable
conflict. The core of this effort is the Consortium's knowledge base&#151;its collection
of information about conflict problems and possible solutions. Our goal is to master this
collection of ideas (most of which were initially generated by others), and to be able to
help parties apply these ideas in particular conflict situations. Our primary focus is on
the special problems of dealing with intractable conflict, with less emphasis on the many
conventional ADR processes embodied in concepts such as principled negotiation and
mediation. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the Consortium's goal is to develop: 1) a diagnostic ability to help
parties determine exactly what problems are present in specific conflict situations, and
2) a prescriptive ability which helps parties identify options for dealing with each
problem, as well as their relative advantages and disadvantages. </p>

<p>The quality of such a service is ultimately dependent on the quality of the information
underlying the advice given. Thus, the Consortium's first objective has been to build its
internal knowledge base to the point where it provides a solid basis for these diagnostic
and prescriptive efforts. To do this, we have pursued a series of projects designed to
incorporate into the Consortium's knowledge base the cumulative expertise of the
conflict-resolution field, as well as knowledge from the many related disciplines which
address the problems of human conflict from other perspectives (e.g. law, politics,
non-violence, military science).(2) In addition to reviewing as many of the classic and
new books and journal articles as we can which relate to the topic of intractable
conflicts, we have undertaken a variety of projects and programs intended to supplement
our knowledge base. These have included the following activities:</p>

<h2>Conferences and Seminars</h2>

<p>A major source of insights incorporated into the Consortium's knowledge base has come
from our continuing series of seminars and conferences. These sessions have involved
presentations by more than 125 scholars, practitioners, and disputants representing many
academic and professional specialties and conflicting parties: advocacy groups,
third-party intervenors, law enforcement officers, journalists, politicians, and others
interested in finding better ways of dealing with resolution-resistant conflicts.
Typically, speakers have suggested ways in which, from their unique perspectives,
confrontations over intractable issues could be handled more constructively. Most of these
presentations, along with the ensuing discussions, were either transcribed and published
as Consortium working papers, or written up by graduate student reporters for the
Consortium <i>Newsletter</i>. In this way, these documents provide a permanent record of
seminar and conference proceedings which has been incorporated into the Consortium's
knowledge base. </p>

<h2>Encyclopedia Project</h2>

<p>The <i>Encyclopedia of Conflict Resolution </i>project, which is nearing completion for
1997 publication by ABC-CLIO, has played a major role in helping the Consortium more fully
incorporate the major accomplishments of the conflict resolution field into our knowledge
base. To help write the encyclopedia, we have built an extensive library and computer
database with abstracts and citations to more than 4500 passages outlining the field's key
insights. Since the encyclopedia project has focused primarily on mainstream alternative
dispute resolution and the handling of tractable disputes, this effort constitutes an
important complement to our long-running examination of intractable conflict. We are
confident that this database and library now represents the majority of the field's
principal ideas.(3) </p>

<h2>Intractable Conflict Database</h2>

<p>In addition to the literature search done in conjunction with the encyclopedia project,
the Consortium has also compiled an extensive library and database of materials
specifically related to intractable conflicts. This database complements the
encyclopedia's more &quot;resolution-oriented&quot; materials with information describing
how traditional dispute handling fields such as law, diplomacy, and politics deal with
resolution-resistant conflicts. It also includes material on confrontation strategies
derived from the work of many advocacy groups, and information on nonviolent confrontation
strategies researched earlier for the Consortium's <i>Justice Without Violence </i>book.
Also included is information documenting how an over-reliance on traditional force-based
strategies can yield counterproductive results. </p>

<h2>University Expertise Projects</h2>

<p>The University's Global Change and Environmental Quality Program has funded a
Consortium project which will bring together university expertise in environmental problem
solving and dispute resolution for distribution over the Internet.(4) The project is
predicated on the fact that large universities, like the University of Colorado, address
conflict problems from many disciplinary perspectives. Our project is designed to make
this collective expertise much more accessible and usable, both on and off the CU campus.
To do this, we are working with University faculty who are teaching courses and conducting
research related to environmental problem solving and conflict. In addition to collecting
and posting information about these courses and research, we are asking each faculty
member to identify key works in their disciplines which relate to environmental problem
solving and dispute resolution.</p>

<p>These works are then being reviewed by Consortium graduate students, who are preparing
executive summaries outlining the key insights of each work, and providing citations to
sources of more detailed information. The resulting database is being made available for
Consortium research, and is being distributed over the Internet as well. We are currently
seeking funds to expand this effort to address other kinds of resolution- resistant
conflicts, and to include scholars and practitioners from other institutions to supplement
the information from CU.(5) </p>

<h2>Searchable Online Case Study Archive</h2>

<p>In many respects, in-depth case studies constitute the field's most useful source of
data, since they can capture the nuances associated with complex conflict situations. To
aid our research the Consortium has created an on-line archive of case studies of
intractable conflicts. Currently, many of the case studies in the archive have come from
students in the Consortium's graduate seminar on intractable conflict management. These
papers, as well as those from Consortium small grant projects and other seminars, make up
the core of the case study archive which is accessible over the Internet with full-text
online searching to be added. Preliminary discussions are underway with other research
centers about pooling case studies into a single searchable database, again available on
the World Wide Web.(6)</p>

<h2>Searchable Online Working Paper Archive</h2>

<p>A similar pooling of the Consortium's general working papers into an online searchable
database is also underway. While we are not yet compiling a multi-institutional working
paper archive, the Consortium's home page on the World Wide Web has links to many Hewlett
and non-Hewlett conflict research centers, many of whom post their working papers on the
Web as well.(7)</p>

<h2>Information Exchange</h2>

<p>The Consortium's oldest effort to use computer technology to facilitate access to the
field's knowledge base is its Information Exchange Program. This program, which was
largely funded by the United States Institute of Peace, combined bibliographic data from
dozens of sources into a single system. The system is still available with continuing
updates and more than 70,000 entries. Our original diskette-based distribution system is
now being replaced with on-line, Internet-based searching.(8) While the Exchange does
suffer from a severe case of information overload, it remains a useful resource. </p>

<h2>Core Literature Projects</h2>

<p>In response to the information overload problem generated by the Information Exchange,
the Consortium undertook two core-bibliography projects, testing the feasibility of
producing more manageable &quot;short lists&quot; of the key works which collectively
embody the field's principal insights. This effort produced two core bibliographies--one
covering ethnic conflict and the other focusing on environmental problem-solving. (This
was a forerunner of the bibliography now being compiled for the University Expertise on
Environmental Problem Solving Project discussed above.) (9)</p>

<h2>Internet Sites</h2>

<p>The field's utilization of the Internet is now high enough that much useful conflict
information is readily available over the Web. Additional conflict-related information is
available on the Web from general sources such as newspapers, government agencies, and
advocacy groups. Given the amount of information an increasingly useful component of the
Consortium's knowledge base project has been the systematic identification of useful
Internet sites. Initially, these site lists were compiled through an extensive search and
review of hundreds of sites by Consortium staff. Using advanced search systems such as
AltaVista, the Consortium is now extending its Internet search capabilities to include
complex, instantly-updated, and precisely-focused Internet searches. These capabilities
are being incorporated into the Consortium's Web Site and are being used as an
increasingly valuable resource in our research and theory-building activities.(10) </p>

<h2>Consortium Library </h2>

<p>The Consortium library has benefited from the incorporation of collections of journals
and books from Elise Boulding and the International Peace Research Association Foundation,
the Department of Sociology's Social Conflict Concentration library, and materials from
the Peace and Conflict Studies library. Appropriate materials from these collections are
being reviewed and added to the Consortium knowledge base databases. They are housed at
the Consortium, where they are available for public use. </p>
