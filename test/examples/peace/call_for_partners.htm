<h2>Call for Contributors</h2>

<p>Throughout this training program we include descriptions of conflict problems,
strategies for limiting those problems, and examples of real world efforts to deal with
difficult conflict situations. We recognize that many users will have ideas and
experiences which can contribute significantly to the program. For this reason we
encourage people to submit materials that they would like to see added to the program.
These materials can be submitted in the form of <a href="mailto:crc@colorado.edu">e-mail </a>messages
or, perhaps, a link to a web site which contains the information. Contributors should also
tell us how we should acknowledge their contribution. We would also appreciate hearing
about others who have materials which we should reference or incorporate into the program.
&nbsp; We are also interested in learning about any errors we may have made or suggestions
for improving the existing materials.</p>

<h2><strong>Call for Local Mirror Sites</strong></h2>

<p>Even in the age of the Internet, the world is a very big place and it takes time to
send information from our computers in Colorado to users around world. To reduce these
times and increase efficiency of the overall system we are looking for local
&quot;mirror&quot; sites who would be willing to post a copy of our materials on their web
server for use in their part of the world. It should be possible to set this up so that we
can do the site administration from Colorado and the demands on mirror site staffs are
limited. We would also be willing to set up a reciprocal arrangement where we provide a
mirror site for your materials. Organizations interested in this opportunity should
contact the <a href="mailto:crc@colorado.edu">Consortium</a> for more information. </p>

<h2><strong>Call for Affiliated Training Programs</strong></h2>

<p>We are also looking for training program affiliates--organizations which would be
interested in providing access to the Consortium system as part of their other training
activities. In exchange we would be willing to advertise their program as a local
affiliate of the Consortium program. Contact the <a href="mailto:crc@colorado.edu">Consortium</a>
for more information</p>
