<p><big>If possible we prefer to receive documents in &quot;html&quot; form. We can also
accept documents in Word Perfect, Microsoft Word, or rich text format (.rtf). RTF files
are the closest thing there is to a universal word processor format. (Virtually every word
processor has the option of saving files in RTF format.) We&nbsp; also ask that you format
your documents as simply as possible. Avoid double columns and especially columns that are
created by tabbing over from the left to the right side of the page. Avoid using different
fonts and font sizes. Stick with either normal text, bold face, or italics. It usually
works better if paragraphs are formatted with a blank line between each paragraph. If you
want to include pictures or figures provide them in separate graphics files. While we can
read most&nbsp; common graphics formats, it would be much better if you could provide
files in either&nbsp; .jpg or .gif&nbsp; formats. Since these are bit map formats the
graphic image has to be at least as big as the image you want to appear on the web. If you
want to use tables, we would prefer to receive them in .html format. If this is not
possible, a simple and widely recognized spreadsheet format like .wk1 (the original Lotus
file)&nbsp; would probably work.&nbsp; For more information on how to deal with graphics
formats and tables give us a call first.&nbsp; While we prefer PC disks or <a
href="mailto:crc@colorado.edu">e-mail</a> attachments, we can also accept Mac disks.</big></p>

<p><big>We can also accept contributions in languages other than English.&nbsp; Such
contributions need to be written in .html format with the language settings properly set
up so that characters are displayed properly.</big></p>
