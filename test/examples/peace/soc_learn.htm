<p>While conflict can be disturbing, painful, destructive, and even catastrophic, it is
also an essential engine of social learning. Social learning occurs when an individual or
group objects to the current state of affairs and proposes improvements. Conflicts arise
when others disagree about the desirability of these proposed changes. The role of
conflict processes is to determine which improvements should be accepted and which should
be rejected. Strategies for dealing with conflict which present suppress this process also
suppress learning. The process of constructive confrontation can therefore be seen as a
mechanism for facilitating social learning, rather than a strategy for suppressing
conflict.<strike></p>
