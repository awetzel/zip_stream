<h3><a name="sysorg"><strong>System Organization</strong></a></h3>

<p>This system has five major sections.&nbsp; The core of the system is made up of two
large lists:&nbsp; a list of common conflict problems, and a second list of possible
treatments for those problems. Each list has a short description of each problem and
solution, and the title is linked to a longer essay describing the problem and solution in
more detail.&nbsp; Linked to these problem and treatment essays are examples--which
illustrate a specific case of the particular problem and/or treatment being
described.&nbsp; (Often, one example will be linked to several different problems and
treatments.)&nbsp; Links to related problems and solutions are also shown. Users who want
a quick answer to a specific question should scan these lists of problems and treatments
to find the ideas that most match their own situation. People who are taking the course or
who want to get the &quot;full training&quot; will want to go through most, if not all, of
the problem and treatment essays, as well as many of the examples.</p>

<p>In addition, the system has a number of background theoretical essays which are
required reading for people taking the course, and are recommended&nbsp; for other users
who are interested in a deeper understanding of conflict processes.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The fifth section is the resources and support services section.&nbsp; Here users can
find bibliographies, a glossary, links to outside sources of information, and a variety of
other user support materials.</p>

<h3>Organization of Problem and Treatment Lists</h3>

<p>The problem and treatment lists are divided into three parts. &nbsp; The first part
involves problem definition--defining what the conflict is about (framing), who is
involved, and what the context of the conflict is (scoping). Without an accurate
understanding of the people and/or issues involved and how the conflict relates to other
situations (past and present) it is very hard to confront any conflict in an effective
way. </p>

<p>The second part looks at complicating factors that often make conflicts worse than they
really should be and make them difficult to handle constructively, even if one takes care
of all of the problems discussed earlier. These complicating factors include communication
problems, fact-finding problems, procedural problems, and escalation.</p>

<p>The third part involves confrontation strategies. People involved in conflicts can do
one of two things. They can withdraw from the conflict, or they can confront it in some
way. When they confront it, they are trying to influence the situation in a way which will
benefit themselves. They may do so in a variety of ways--they may use force, they may try
to negotiate, or they may try to persuade the opponent to change his or her attitudes
and/or behavior.&nbsp; Sections address each of these three topics as well as overall
treatment strategies which combine multiple approaches.</p>

<h3><a name="howuse"><strong>How to Use the System</strong></a></h3>

<p>There are many ways to use this system. You may skip around from link to link reading
only those topics that are of direct interest to you or relevance to your immediate
situation. This enables you to &quot;customize&quot; the information you receive to match
your specific situation. Or you may go straight through, reading most or all of the
information on all of the entries. While this takes much longer, it gives a much better
overview of the nature of intractable conflicts in general and how they can be approached
in more constructive ways. </p>

<p>To simplify programming, it is often necessary to go back to the previous screen to get
the menu of other choices.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this use the &quot;go back&quot; arrow on
your browser. </p>

<h3><a name="Quick Tour">Quick Tour</a></h3>

<p>To illustrate the kind of information contained in the program, this quick tour takes
you to some of the sections which deal with communication problems attributable to
cultural barriers.&nbsp; The tour starts in the on-line consulting menu.&nbsp; All you do
is click on the links marked: <font color="#800000"><em><big><strong>**TOUR*</strong></big></em></font></p>
