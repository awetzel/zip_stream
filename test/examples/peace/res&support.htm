  <dt><strong><a href="multilingual_information.htm">Multilingual Capabilities</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Although all of the material is now available only in English, we have tried to write in
    a style that we hope will be understandable to people with limited English skills. An
    online dictionary provides definitions of specialized terms which may not be found in
    standard translations dictionaries. We are also including multilingual program
    descriptions.<font color="#800000"> </font>As a further translation aid, we have included
    a link to AltaVista's free online translation service. While this is primitive and should
    be used with caution, it may still be useful.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="online_disc.htm">Online Discussions and Listserver</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>An online discussion and listserve is being established for this program.&nbsp; Links to
    other listserves of interest are also given. </dd>
  <dt><a href="use_suggestions.htm"><strong>Access Options and Suggestions for Using this
    Program More Efficiently</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Access options area available for people with a high capacity internet connection, a low
    capacity internet connection, computers without an Internet connection, and for those
    without a computer. This section contains echnical notes on how to get the most out of the
    system in a variety of settings. </dd>
  <dt><a href="glossary.htm"><strong>Glossary</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This glossary contains short definitions of terms that are used in ways that differ from
    common English usage, or for some other reason might not be easily understood.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="ref&amp;fr1.htm">References and Further Reading</a></strong></dt>
  <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a list of books and articles that we
    have found useful in our study of intractable conflicts.</dt>
  <dt><a href="links_page.htm"><strong>Useful Links</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Many of the problem and treatment write-ups have links to outside sources of information
    (on the Internet), but this is a short list of World Wide Web Sites which have a great
    deal of information which relates directly to the topics we are dealing with here. A
    longer list of sites of varying degrees of relevance to intractable conflict can be found
    at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/links">http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/othersites.htm</a></dd>
