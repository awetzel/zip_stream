<p>An outcome is considered a &quot;win&quot; if it leaves a party in a better position
than they expect. In a similar way, a &quot;loss&quot; occurs when a party is left in a
worse position than they expect. Here the key concept is &quot;expectations.&quot; In
cases where the parties expect to be worse off in the future they are likely to regard a
settlement which leaves them &quot;less worse off&quot; as a &quot;win.&quot; For example,
a group which feels that it is on the brink of military defeat is likely to view a
favorable surrender agreement as a &quot;win.&quot; An environmental group which expects
the logging industry to continue destructive logging practices may consider a modest
improvement in those practices to be a &quot;win.&quot;Conversely, a group that expects to
win is likely to view a settlement which slightly limits their winnings as a loss. This is
one reason why armies which are on the verge of victory are often unwilling to accept a
settlement short of total surrender. This also helps explain why winning parties are
reluctant to share their winnings.</p>

<p>These expectations are also referred to as &quot;expected alternatives to a &nbsp;
negotiated agreement, or EATNAs.&quot;&nbsp; EATNAs do not have to be realistic to
motivate behavior. Whatever the parties believe about their alternatives is going to
determine what they do. If their beliefs are inaccurate, then they are likely to make poor
decisions which they are likely to regret and which they would not have made had they had
better information. This is one reason why efforts to help parties accurately assess their
alternatives to negotiated agreements are such an important part of efforts to make
conflicts more constructive. </p>

<p>(More information on EATNAs is found in <strong><a href="essay/con_conf.htm">Constructive
Confrontation Theoretical Framework</a> </strong>and in<strong> </strong><a name="batna"></a><strong><a href="problem/batna.htm">Limits to Agreement: Better Alternatives</a>.&nbsp; </strong>Information
