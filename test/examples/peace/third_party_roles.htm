<p>Although much of the material in this training program is useful for disputants acting
on their own, we do recognize that the people who are likely to use this resource first
are third parties.&nbsp; As a third party, you can use this material in a large variety of
ways.&nbsp; First, the material should give you a good understanding of how intractable
conflicts are different from more tractable conflicts.&nbsp; This should make clear why
techniques that work in one instance do not work in another.&nbsp; Second, you can use the
material provided to analyze what it is about the conflict(s) you are involved in that are
making them so difficult to deal with.&nbsp; By going through the list of common conflict
problems, you should be able to identify what core factors are involved, whether these
kinds of core issues tend to lead to intractable conflicts, or not, and what can be done
to address these issues constructively, even if they cannot be resolved.&nbsp; In
addition, you can identify complicating factors that are making the conflict more
destructive than necessary, and then use your own knowledge--with or without our
suggestions--regarding approaches for minimizing or limiting these complicating factors.</p>

<p>In addition to using these materials yourself, we hope you will tell the disputants you
are working with about this site, so that they can use it to.&nbsp; If you have
suggestions about how we can make this site better or more useful to you, please contact
us by clicking on the e-mail address below.</p>
