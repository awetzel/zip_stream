<p>Dear user,<br>
<br>
your request<br>
<br>
SUBSCRIBE conflict_training Conflict Consortium<br>
<br>
has been successfully processed.<br>
<br>
<br>
********** HOW TO POST TO THE LIST **********<br>
<br>
Welcome to list conflict_training (conflict_training@lists.Colorado.EDU).<br>
The system has recorded<br>
your address as<br>
<br>
crc@spot.colorado.edu<br>
<br>
and it is required that you send your postings from this address.<br>
<br>
********** HOW TO GET OFF THE LIST **********<br>
<br>
To sign off from the list, email to listproc@lists.Colorado.EDU with the<br>
following request:<br>
<br>
signoff conflict_training<br>
or<br>
unsubscribe conflict_training<br>
<br>
********** GETTING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ATTRIBUTES **********<br>
<br>
You may get your current subscription attributes at any time by sending the<br>
following request to listproc@lists.Colorado.EDU:<br>
<br>
query conflict_training<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
********** WHERE TO SEND EMAIL **********<br>
<br>
If you want to post messages to list conflict_training, you should direct<br>
your emails<br>
to conflict_training@lists.Colorado.EDU, not listproc@lists.Colorado.EDU. If<br>
you wish to send requests please do<br>
not send them to the list -- they will not be processed. Instead direct them<br>
to listproc@lists.Colorado.EDU. Requests sent to listproc@lists.Colorado.EDU<br>
should be placed in the<br>
body of the email message, not the Subject:. ListProc ignores requests in the<br>
Subject: field.<br>
<br>
You can, however, put as many requests as you like in one mail message; each<br>
request should be on a line by itself. If your request is too long for your<br>
mailer to handle, you can break it in multiple lines, but each line should<br>
end with the character &amp; (ampersand). For example, here are two separate<br>
requests:<br>
<br>
set conflict_training &amp;<br>
mail &amp;<br>
ack<br>
help<br>
<br>
The ampersands in the above example are immediately followed by carriage<br>
returns. The above requests are equivalent to:<br>
<br>
set conflict_training mail ack<br>
help<br>
<br>
********** LIST OWNERS **********<br>
<br>

Review requests are available to privileged users (e.g. owners) only.<br>

********** ACCESS TO THE LIST'S ARCHIVES ********** <br>
<br>
The list is not currently archived, therefore it is not possible to get past<br>
postings.<br>
