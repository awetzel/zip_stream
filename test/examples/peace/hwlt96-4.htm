<hr>

<p>With the information collected through the knowledge base projects, we have reached
certain conclusions about the nature of intractable conflict. These conclusions have, in
turn, led us to identify a number of principles which the Consortium is following in its
efforts to find better ways of dealing with intractable conflicts:</p>

<h2>The Incremental Approach</h2>

<p>Completely reworking the process through which society addresses intractable issues is
rarely a realistic option. Given the enormous stakes involved in such conflicts, it is
virtually impossible to get full agreement to adopt a new approach. We believe that a more
realistic approach is an incremental one, which concentrates on identifying particular
problems and implementing precisely-focused initiatives to correct them. This incremental
approach will not solve all problems or resolve intractable conflicts permanently, but it
can make resolution resistant conflicts more constructive than they would otherwise be.</p>

<h2>Avoid One-Size-Fits-All Solutions</h2>

<p>Our work clearly indicates that a successful constructive confrontation program must
offer a wide range of options, each tailored to the specific conflict, the stage of the
dispute process, the special needs of adversaries, intermediaries, and bystanders, and
differing cultural backgrounds and personal priorities. Solutions which can be implemented
unilaterally are needed, as are those dependent on collaborative action and third-party
intervenors. For this reason, we are not pursuing a single approach for use in all
conflict situations. Rather, we focus on a framework for looking at a conflict, then
designing specific strategies for dealing with unique combinations of problems and
opportunities. </p>

<h2>Consider Long- and Short-Term Measures of Success </h2>

<p>The Consortium is looking at intractable conflict from both long-term and short-term
perspectives. Over the long term, the parties need to understand that the underlying
conflict (between the rich and the poor, for example) will generate a continuing series of
disputes. Thus, the underlying conflict will not be resolved with the short-term
settlement of a single dispute episode. Thus, parties need to plan strategies which deal
constructively with both the immediate dispute and inevitable subsequent disputes. They
should not use excessive force or unnecessarily destructive tactics, thinking they can win
&quot;once and for all,&quot; because they are likely to generate a backlash that is
strong enough to reverse their short-term gains.</p>

<h2>Recognize That Confrontation Is Largely a Part-Time, Do-It-Yourself Process</h2>

<p>Professional conflict intervention is expensive. Only a small number of the
confrontations that any society faces can be facilitated by conflict professionals. Most
must be handled by the parties themselves. For these people, confrontation or conflict
resolution is only a part-time, do-it-yourself activity. Without effective training, they
are likely to employ &quot;seat-of-the-pants&quot; conflict resolution and confrontation
skills, without benefiting from the considerable insights of the conflict resolution
field. The Consortium is looking for quick, easy, and inexpensive ways of disseminating
the field's knowledge to these individuals so they don't have to &quot;reinvent the
wheel.&quot;</p>

<h2>Everyone Has a Role to Play in Producing More Constructive Confrontations</h2>

<p>Increasing the constructiveness of society's most difficult confrontations is not just
the job of professional intermediaries or even the principal parties. Virtually everyone
has an important role to play in this effort. The media, law enforcement officers,
decision makers, religious leaders, politicians, business leaders, and the general public
all influence the way intractable conflicts are played out. For this reason, better
confrontation strategies are needed for implementation by all of these people. </p>

<h2>Recognize the Existence of Unavoidable Win-Lose Conflict</h2>

<p>Persons working to limit destructive confrontations need to recognize that many
underlying issues are likely to have an unavoidable win-lose character. Such unavoidable
win-lose conflicts are of three principal types: 1) fundamental moral conflicts in which
one group views the actions of another as intolerably evil, 2) high-stakes distributional
questions over &quot;who gets what,&quot; and 3) social status or domination conflicts
which arise when individuals or groups compete for preferred positions in the social
hierarchy. </p>

<h2>Recognize That Win-Win Opportunities Still Exist Within Intractable Conflicts</h2>

<p>Within the context of win-lose conflict, there will likely be numerous sub-issues and
disputes which offer the parties win-win opportunities. One Consortium goal is to help
parties understand how to identify and pursue these opportunities, even while they
continue to struggle with underlying win-lose issues. </p>

<h2>Recognize the Limits to Agreement-Based Approaches </h2>

<p>Given the importance parties attach to high-stakes conflicts over intractable issues,
it is unrealistic to expect them to voluntarily accept an agreement if they believe that
their interests can be better advanced through some power-based strategy (e.g. litigation,
lobbying, elections, strikes, boycotts, non-violent protests, or military campaigns).
Efforts to deal with intractable conflicts more constructively must recognize and work
within existing power relationships. </p>

<h2>Directly Address Issues of Justice</h2>

<p>Any modifications to confrontation processes are likely to alter the outcome of
individual disputes in significant ways. Therefore, it is imperative that any changes
which the Consortium might propose be explicitly evaluated to make sure that they
genuinely advance the cause of &quot;justice.&quot; Since justice means different things
to different people, this evaluation process must seek common principles that bind diverse
communities together. </p>

<h2>Address the Empowerment/Neutrality Problem</h2>

<p>Some steps toward increasing the constructiveness of the confrontation process can best
be taken by neutral third parties. There are other steps, however, which we believe can be
better taken from an advocacy perspective. The empowerment of disempowered groups is one
example. Although neutral intervenors (such as mediators) often try to empower the
lower-power parties, they cannot do much empowerment without compromising their
neutrality. For this reason, it is often useful to create separate roles of neutral
intervenor and advocacy advisor, so the latter can more freely work on empowerment issues
and the former can remain truly neutral.</p>

<h2>Present Ideas from a First-Party/Advocacy Perspective</h2>

<p>The adversary groups, which are the driving force behind intractable conflict, are not
interested in resolving conflicts for the sake of resolution. They are interested in
advancing their interests. Conflict professionals (neutrals or advocacy advisors) must,
therefore, be able to show them how a more sophisticated understanding of conflict
processes can help them advance their interests. Without this, we should not expect them
to follow our suggestions.</p>
