<h1>FRAMEWORK FOR ORGANIZING INFORMATION ABOUT MORE CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO
INTRACTABLE CONFLICT </h1>

<hr>

<h2>Theoretical Framework</h2>

<p>Our constructive confrontation approach assumes that intense, continuing confrontations
over important and difficult issues are inevitable. What is avoidable is the
destructiveness commonly associated with them. To limit such destructiveness, we suggest
that parties and intermediaries involved in intractable conflicts should focus not on the
unrealistic goal of resolution, but on how these conflicts can be conducted more
constructively.</p>

<h2>The Medical Model</h2>

<p>Constructive confrontation follows a medical model in which destructive conflict
processes are likened to diseases&#151;pathological conditions that adversely affect
people, organizations, and society as a whole. Sometimes these &quot;diseases&quot; can be
completely cured; at other times, we can only limit their most troublesome symptoms. As in
medicine, some pathological processes seem to resist all available treatment, though we
hope that further research will yield effective remedies. (We must be clear that conflict
processes <i>are not</i>, in themselves, pathological. Conflict plays an essential role in
social evolution and human betterment. Our goal is to control the<i> destructive</i>
conflict dynamics which can overwhelm these benefits.)</p>

<p>As does medicine, constructive confrontation takes an incremental approach. Rather than
looking at conflict as a single problem and asking how it can be completely
&quot;resolved,&quot; constructive confrontation looks at each aspect of the conflict
process, asking whether it is effective and constructive, and if not, how it might be
improved. </p>

<p>While constructive confrontation differs considerably from current mediation practice,
it builds upon that field's considerable experience by applying those skills in different
settings. As such, we see constructive confrontation extending mediation's contributions
to situations where the resolution and problem-solving models have not been as effective
as we would all like. </p>

<h2>Constructive Confrontation Steps</h2>

<p>As in medicine, the first step in constructive confrontation is diagnosis. This process
begins with preparation of a <i>conflict map</i>. Such a map identifies actual and
potential adversary groups and intermediaries, along with their interests and positions.
It also places the immediate dispute within the context of the long-term, underlying
conflict. </p>

<p>The diagnosis then differentiates the <i>core </i>aspects of the conflict from what we
call<i> conflict overlays</i>. Overlays are problems in the conflict process that get
&quot;laid over&quot; the core issues, making them harder to see and address. Examples
include escalation and polarization, misunderstandings, and problems with fact-finding,
procedure, and framing (See Figure 2). After overlay problems are diagnosed, problems in
the core confrontation process must also be identified. These include unidentified power
options, inadequate assessment of the costs and benefits of various options, overlooking
&quot;ripe&quot; moments, and needless pursuit of power struggles to the
&quot;bitter-end.&quot;</p>

<h2>Identification, Selection, and Implementation of Treatment Options</h2>

<p>After destructive conflict dynamics are diagnosed, constructive confrontation moves to
identify and implement realistic, incremental steps to reduce as many of the overlay
problems as possible. Some remedies involve easy &quot;don't do its&quot;&#151;pitfalls
which are easy to avoid once you see them (e.g. gratuitous insults which unnecessarily
promote hostility). Other steps require either the acquisition of new skills (e.g., active
listening), outside assistance from conflict professionals (e.g., facilitation,
transformative mediation, or structured dialogues), or risky hard choices such as pursuing
a short-term victory that may provoke a damaging, long-term backlash.</p>

<p>While some remedies can be implemented unilaterally, others require the joint efforts
of adversaries and intermediaries. Once specific options are selected and implemented,
results should be monitored and needed adjustments made as the conflict changes over time.
This approach is also important in treating core conflict pathologies. </p>

<p>Although constructive confrontation can be practiced unilaterally, third parties or
advocacy advisors can help identify and assess alternative power options, and recognize or
even create moments ripe for settlement. More information about how this can be done is
included in &quot;Constructive Confrontation: An Overview,&quot; in Appendix 7.</p>
