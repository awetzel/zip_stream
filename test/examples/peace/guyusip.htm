<p><font SIZE="+2"><strong>Military Force</strong></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Military force, which is used primarily in international settings and
serious internal political conflicts (civil war, for example) represents society's efforts
to combine its resources to create an organization capable of successfully resisting any
effort to use violent force against it. Such military forces are, of course, also
frequently used for aggressive purposes. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Military science has a long and complex history with enormous resources
traditionally devoted to the development of better weapons and tactics and the training of
each new generation of soldiers, sailors, and airmen. While further discussion of these
ideas is beyond the scope of this training program, we do include the following links to
Web accessible resources on the subject. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2"><strong>Political Power</strong></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">In order to be successful, societies have had to develop political
institutions capable of limiting internal violence by providing effective alternatives to
violence-based dispute resolution mechanisms and by the development of police and military
institutions capable of preventing citizens and other nations from using violent
strategies to pursue their interests. These political institutions provide nonviolent (or
at least less violent) mechanisms for making broad policy decisions and enacting laws
which govern the way in which the legal or judicial system resolves day-to-day disputes.
These political institutions also specify the exact circumstances under which police and
military can use their monopoly on overwhelming violent force.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Over the centuries different societies have developed very different
political institutions. Common contemporary political systems include those based upon
religious law, democratic principles, monarchies, and dictatorships. These political
systems have developed into large scale social institutions which are extensively studied
and for which there are numerous education and training options available to those working
in the political arena. While further discussion of political systems is beyond the scope
of this training program, we do include the following links to Web accessible resources on
the subject.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2"><strong>Legal Power</strong></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Political institutions deal primarily with broad policy questions. They
are not intended to deal with the large number of disputes which inevitably arise over the
implementation of broad political policies and, especially, the enforcement of laws
enacted by the political process. For dealing with these day-to-day conflicts virtually
all societies have enacted establish some type of legal or judicial system whose judgments
are backed up by the power of the police. In addition to the enforcement of political
decisions the legal system also provides a mechanism for resolving the many civil disputes
which arise between individual citizens..</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">Different societies organize their legal institutions in very different
ways. For example, legal systems in current use include those based upon English Common
Law, religious law, or traditional approaches in which community elders are responsible
for arranging just settlements.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">In most societies extensive legal institutions have developed which
employ substantial resources and large numbers of skilled people who receive extensive
training in professional schools. While further discussion of legal systems is beyond the
scope of this training program, we do include the following links to Web accessible
resources on the subject.</font></p>
