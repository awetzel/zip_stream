<hr>

<p>Exchange is one of Kenneth Boulding's &quot;three faces of power,&quot; the other two
being force (or threat) and love (or the integrative system).&nbsp; In conflict resolution
terminology, exchange is usually negotiation.&nbsp; Although the fundamental issues
involved in an intractable conflict are often not considered negotiable, negotiation is
often attempted anyhow.&nbsp; When it is used effectively for negotiable aspects of the
dispute, and not applied to situations when it is inappropriate, it can work to resolve
some disputes and help make the remaining conflicts more constructive.&nbsp; When it is
not done effectively, however, or when it is tried when the situation is not
&quot;ripe&quot; for resolution, it can actually make situations worse.&nbsp; The list of
exchange problems gives an overview of the typical kinds of things that can go wrong, with
links (in the full write ups) to possible treatments.</p>
