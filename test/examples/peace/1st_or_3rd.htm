  <dd>This program is designed for:&nbsp; </dd>
  <dd>- people who are involved in conflicts that they do not know how to handle or conflicts
    that never seems to end </dd>
  <dd>- people who are trying to help others who are involved in a difficult or long-lasting
    conflict</dd>
  <dd>- people who are interested in learning about more constructive ways of approaching
    difficult conflicts in general</dd>
  <dd>-&nbsp;people who are interested in learning more about the field of conflict resolution</dd>

<h3>Three Approaches to Conflict</h3>

<p>There are three principle perspectives from which people approach conflict problems.
First, there are the adversaries or contending parties. These are people who become
involved in conflict as part of efforts to protect their rights or advance their
interests. Typically, there are &quot;first parties,&quot; people who want something to
change, and &quot;second parties,&quot; people who don't want it to change. These are the
groups who are fighting one another and without them there would be no conflict. They are
not interested in resolving conflicts for the sake of resolution. They are interested in
winning, and doing so at the lowest possible cost. </p>

<p>Second, there are bystanders--people who don't really care who wins the conflict, but
who are being adversely affected by the conflict and would like to see it resolved. &nbsp;
Sometimes, these are people who are literally caught in the cross-fire between opposing
military forces and, as a result, they are having their lives threatened and their
property destroyed. In other, less extreme, cases they are citizens of communities that
are being so torn apart by conflict that they are losing their ability to function
effectively. </p>

<p>Third, there are people who are not being adversely affected by the conflict, but who
want to try to help the disputants work out their problems.&nbsp; This kind of person is
often called a &quot;third party&quot; or and &quot;intermediary&quot;--someone who goes
in between the parties to try to help them communicate better, and to work out a solution
to their problems.&nbsp; Mediators are one kind of third party; arbitrators, facilitators,
and conciliators are others.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, there are likely to be significant differences in the kinds of
conflict management or resolution techniques that the three groups (adversaries,
bystanders, and intermediaries) are likely to adopt. Adversaries are often not&nbsp; very
interested in resolution because they feel that they will be pressured to accept unwanted
compromises which will not protect their interests.&nbsp; Therefore, they tend to follow
force-based strategies, with help from people such as community organizers,&nbsp; labor
organizers, lawyers, political strategists, and military and para-military forces, all of
whom are familiar with force-based confrontational techniques.</p>

<p>Bystanders and intermediary groups (which often includes the society as a whole) tend
to focus upon efforts to halt the confrontation regardless of who wins. They often seek
help from judges, political leaders, police forces, as well as mediators, facilitators and
consensus builders to help them better control destructive conflicts. Yet the disputing
parties themselves are the ones that are really in control.&nbsp; If they want to continue
conflict as usual, little can be done to change the situation.&nbsp; If they are willing
to try some new approaches, significant progress can be made to make most conflicts more
constructive.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Disputants' Use of this System</h3>

<p>For this reason, this training program is written in ways which emphasize the utility
of these ideas for disputants as well as intermediaries.&nbsp; We want the people who are
involved in conflicts themselves to look at these materials, and use them to reconsider
the ways they are framing and addressing their conflicts.&nbsp; While some of these
approaches require the cooperation of all the disputants or the assistance of a third
party,&nbsp; there are a large number of steps which can be taken by one party
alone&#150;without requiring cooperative efforts of opponents. This obviously makes it
much easier to adopt alternative approaches. Another reason why we focus upon strategies
which are appealing to, and can be directly implemented by, adversaries is that there is
often simply not enough money to hire intermediaries. Consequently,&nbsp; many conflicts
have to be handled by the adversaries themselves. These adversary-oriented approaches
should also make the job of intermediaries easier, since it emphasizes steps which
adversaries have good reason to adopt. All of this explains why we have presented many of
the materials in this training program from the parties, rather than an intermediary,
perspective. </p>

<h3>Intermediary (Third Party)'s Use of this System</h3>

<p>Although much of this system focuses on the disputant's perspective, it is easy for
third parties to use the system as well.&nbsp; They should simply read through the
problems and ask themselves if that problem is arising in the conflict situation they are
involved in.&nbsp; For each problem they identify, they can then examine the treatment
options, considering which they can help the parties implement, which the parties might be
able to implement on their own (perhaps with a suggestion from the third party), and which
are not likely to be helpful.</p>
