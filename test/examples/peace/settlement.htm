<hr>

<p>Just as conflict scholars often distinguish between short-term conflicts (or disputes)
and long term conflicts, many also distinguish between &quot;dispute settlement,&quot;
&quot;conflict management,&quot; and &quot;conflict resolution.&quot; Disputes are usually
settled permanently by working out a mutually-satisfactory agreement through negotiation
or mediation, or by adjudication in which an expert (a judge, a jury, or an arbitrator)
decides that one side was right, and the other was wrong. In both situations, the dispute
is settled--that is, it is ended. </p>

<p>When long-term conflicts are ended, scholars say they are &quot;resolved.&quot; By this
they mean that a relatively stable solution has been found by identifying and dealing with
the underlying sources of the conflict. This is more difficult to do than simple
&quot;dispute settlement,&quot; because resolution means going beyond negotiating
interests to meeting all sides' basic needs, and finding a way to respect their underlying
values and identity. This often requires making significant socio-economic or political
changes that restructure society in a more just or inclusive way.</p>

<p>&quot;Conflict management&quot; involves the control, but not resolution, of a
long-term or deep-rooted conflict. This is the approach of choice when complete resolution
seems to be impossible. In this case, a conflict can be managed to make it more
constructive and less destructive--thus making the results of the ongoing conflict more
beneficial and less damaging to all sides. </p>
