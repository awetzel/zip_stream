<h1 align="center">Constructive Confrontation Steps</h1>

<hr>

<p>Constructive Confrontation involves four steps: 1) conflict assessment; 2)solution
identification and selection; 3) implementation, and 4) solution evaluation and revision</p>

<h3>1. Conflict Assessment</h3>

<p>Conflict assessment involves the identification of what the conflict is about, who is
involved, why they are involved, and what complicating factors are making the situation
especially difficult to deal with effectively. </p>

<p>People who routinely deal with conflicts--lawyers, mediators, and diplomats, for
instance, always do a conflict assessment before they decide how to approach a problem.
They try to understand as much as they can about what is going on and who is involved so
that they can plan and then carry out an appropriate response.</p>

<p>People who are involved in a conflict themselves often overlook the importance of doing
a conflict assessment. They assume that they know what is going on, who is involved and
why, and what they should do about it. When conflicts are simple--when they involve only
two people and one or two issues, for example--a conflict assessment may not be important.
</p>

<p>But when conflicts are complex --involving many people, many issues, perhaps having a
long history and strong emotions, it is very helpful to conduct a conflict assessment
before deciding how to respond. If you are being helped by a conflict professional (a
lawyer or mediator, for instance) they can help you do the conflict assessment, or may do
it for you. If you are acting on your own, however, you should do your own conflict
assessment before making choices about appropriate ways to address specific opponents or
issues, or how to handle the conflict over the long term.</p>

<p>HOW TO DO A CONFLICT ASSESSMENT: Many conflict assessment guides are available. Most
often, they consist of lists of questions to answer or things to consider before dealing
with a conflict. Although the lists differ in details, most contain many similar elements.
These include questions about who is involved, what they want (or need) that they do not
have, and how they are trying to get their needs or desires met.</p>

<p>This website is, in itself, a detailed conflict assessment tool. By working through the
website and answering the questions it asks, you will get a detailed understanding of the
conflicts you are involved in, including the nature of the core conflict and the
complicating factors or problems that are making the conflict more difficult to handle.
Once you understand this you can move on to the identification and selection of solutions
for particular problems. If you want a shorter, simpler conflict assessment tool, several
are available. (See below.)</p>

<h3>2. Identification and Selection of Solutions to Problems</h3>

<p>After the conflict assessment is completed, disputants (and third parties) should have
a better understanding of the problems they are facing. If the conflict appears to be
negotiable, and if the parties are ready to sit down and negotiate, settlement is usually
relatively simple to obtain.</p>

<p>In long-lasting, intense, and complex conflicts, however, obtaining even a short-term
settlement can be very difficult. Often, the best that can be done is to deal with
individual problems within the context of the larger conflict. For instance, if
misunderstandings are a problem, efforts can be made to improve communication between the
parties. If procedural issues are in dispute, procedures can be changed to make them more
open and fair. While incremental solutions to particular problems will not fairly resolve
the conflict, they can make it more manageable and more constructive. They will help limit
the complicating factors, allowing the parties to focus more of their attention on the
core aspects of the conflict and do so in a way that is more likely to advance their
interests than they could when complicating factors distorted the situation.</p>

<h3>3. Implementation of Solutions</h3>

<p>The third step in constructive confrontation is the implementation of the solutions
chosen in step two to limit complicating factors and to increase the effectiveness of the
confrontation over the core issues. Since resolution-resistant conflicts are usually
complex and involve a number of different complicating factors, a choice must be made
about timing of the solution steps. One problem can be taken at a time, or several can be
dealt with at once. The optimal approach will be different in each case. For this reason
parties must look at the security of the problems and the availability of solutions to
make a judgment about what to do when.</p>

<h3>4. Evaluation and revision </h3>

<p>Resolution-resistant conflicts are often so complex that it is impossible to predict
what the outcome of any particular action might be. Solutions that are expected remedy a
problem may do so, or they might not. They also might create unexpected problems in other
areas. For this reason, it is critical that parties carefully evaluate the results of all
of their actions, and revise their conflict strategies as needed in an effort to make the
confrontation as constructive as possible.</p>
