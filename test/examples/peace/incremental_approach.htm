<p><strong><font FACE="Times New Roman">The Incremental Approach</font></strong></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">We believe that an incremental approach offers the best
way to reduce the destructiveness of confrontations over intractable issues. This approach
begins by helping parties (both adversaries and intermediaries) identify conflict problems
which increase the conflict's overall destructiveness or threaten the parties' ability to
make wise decisions or advance their interests. We then provide parties with information
about options for dealing with each problem and their advantages and disadvantages. While
it is usually impossible to correct all such problems, our goal is to help people fix as
many of the problems as possible, and reduce the magnitude of problems that cannot be
eliminated .</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Although many of our &quot;treatments&quot; require the
cooperative efforts of contending parties (often with the assistance of intermediaries),
others can be implemented unilaterally. Similarly, some treatments are relatively easy to
implement, while others require that the parties develop new dispute-handling skills or
secure the assistance of outside professionals. Unlike other forms of dispute resolution,
this incremental approach can work in situations where resolution-based approaches are
unworkable. It also makes sense in cases where it is unrealistic to expect major changes
in dispute-handling process or decision-making institutions.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Accumulating Knowledge Base</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">While there are no proven and reliable strategies for
resolving intractable conflicts, the field's accumulating knowledge base does offer a rich
array of ideas for making inevitable confrontations far more constructive. Some of these
ideas have a long history as essential elements of every dispute resolution practitioner's
toolbox. Also of great value are many of the dispute handling techniques used by the many
more traditional conflict professionals (e.g. politicians, lawyers, soldiers, and judges).
Other useful ideas arise from basic research and theory building in the social sciences
where all that is needed is to present the ideas in widely understandable terms, rather
than inscrutable academic lingo. Finally, there are the creative ideas of citizens who are
struggling to find better ways of dealing with the difficult conflicts that they confront
in their daily lives.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">At this point the Consortium has identified more than 125
common problems which undermine the constructiveness with which intractable conflicts are
addressed. More encouraging is the fact that we have also identified 150 realistic steps
which can be taken to limit these problems. We have arranged these problems and treatments
into nine categories found in Figure 1. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">A principal advantage of this problem/treatment approach
is that it is highly adaptable to the special circumstances of particular conflicts. There
is no single approach which can be expected to work in all situations. Each conflict
creates different combinations of problems which require different combinations of
treatments.</font></p>
