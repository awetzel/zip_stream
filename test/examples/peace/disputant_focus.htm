<p><strong><font FACE="Times New Roman">Most Conflicts Are Not Professionally Mediated</font></strong></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Professional conflict intervention is expensive. Only a
tiny percentage of conflict-related interactions can be mediated by conflict
professionals. Most interactions are handled by either the parties themselves or informal
intermediaries--people who are acting as mediators or arbitrators, but do not have formal
training in those skills. For these people, confrontation and conflict resolution is a
&quot;do-it-yourself&quot; activity. In the absence of effective training, these people
are likely to employ common knowledge approaches which fail to benefit from either
scientific studies of conflict processes or the practical experiences of those who have
struggled with similar conflicts in the past.&nbsp; If these &quot;do-it-yourselfers&quot;
had easy access to answers to specific questions, we reasoned, they would be able to
approach their problem in a more constructive and effective way.&nbsp; This program is
designed to offer those answers. </font></p>

<p><strong><font FACE="Times New Roman">Quick Responses Are Needed</font></strong></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">People in conflicts often have to make strategic choices
relatively quickly.&nbsp; Their opponent will make a demand or escalate the conflict--the
immediate question becomes how to respond.&nbsp; Disputants cannot then sign up for a
conflict management training program that starts in six months.&nbsp; They need help now!
&nbsp; If conflict training can be provided to these disputants during this critical time
frame, they are likely to take them. They are also likely to return to this resource in
the future as additional conflict problems arise. This, in turn, is likely to lead to
long-term improvements in their overall conflict skills. If such information is not
forthcoming, the parties can be expected to stick with often destructive,
&quot;business-as-usual&quot; practices.&nbsp; A major focus of the Consortium program
has, therefore, been the creation of a dissemination program that works within these
narrow time constraints<strong>.</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Disputant Interests are Different</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">In addition, disputants interests are usually different
from those of intermediaries.&nbsp; Unlike intermediaries who want to resolve conflicts,
adversaries often want victory more than they want resolution. They often distrust dispute
resolution, because they think it will force them to compromise or give up what they want
or need. Rather, they want to know how they can press their cause more effectively. &nbsp;
The only time they will turn to dispute resolution processes is when they think that these
processes will get them more than they would get otherwise.&nbsp; This is why a major
focus of the Consortium's work has been the application of the field's insights from the
first-party, disputant perspective, as well as the traditional, third-party, neutral
perspective. </font></p>

<p><strong><font FACE="Times New Roman">Disputants Can Do Things that Intermediaries Can
Not </font></strong></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">While many steps toward increasing the constructiveness of
the confrontation process can best be taken by neutral intermediaries, there are other
steps which can be better taken from an advocacy perspective. One example involves the
empowerment of the disempowered. Although many intermediaries try to &quot;level the
playing field&quot; by empowering the lower-power parties, they cannot do much empowerment
without compromising their neutrality. For this reason, we believe that it is useful to
create separate roles for conflict professionals--neutral intermediaries and partisan
advocacy advisors or coaches. Here the later can freely pursue empowerment goals while the
former can take advantage of opportunities available only to true neutrals. These advisors
can show the parties how a more sophisticated understanding of conflict dynamics can help
them better pursue their interests. This understanding can help the parties see
alternative approaches as well as legal, political and other force-based strategies in a
broader perspective.</font></p>

<p><strong><font FACE="Times New Roman">Everyone Has a Role to Play in&nbsp; </font>Producing
More Constructive Confrontations</strong></p>

<p>Increasing the constructiveness of society's most difficult confrontations is not just
the job of professional intermediaries or even the principal parties. Virtually everyone
has an important role to play in this effort. The media, law enforcement officers,
decision makers, religious leaders, politicians, business leaders, and the general public
all influence the way intractable conflicts are played out. For this reason, better
confrontation strategies are needed for implementation by all of these people. </p>
