<p>Consider the following scenario: Ruth is a senior manager in a government department.
Her deputy, John, was one of the applicants for the position she holds and he was very
angry when he was not appointed. John treats Ruth in a formal, unfriendly but polite
manner. He carries out her instructions precisely, but never does more than she explicitly
tells him. Ruth decides that the tension between them is destructive, both for her and for
the workplace, and decides to meet with John in an attempt to clear the air'. Although he
agrees to the meeting, he insists that there is no problem, that his treatment or her is
entirely appropriate, and that he has no wish to have any sort of informal or personal
relationship with her. (Tillett 1997, 31) How might Ruth communicate in her upcoming
meeting with her deputy to reduce tension between them? </p>

<p>First, she would ask herself where it should take place. The physical setting can help
or hinder communication. His coming to her office would emphasize the status difference
and the related resentment already blocking communication. Her visiting his office might
seem contrived. As neutral and businesslike a setting as possible would be recommended
here. </p>

<p>Second, she would describe the tension she feels between them, and ask him what he
thinks might be done to reduce it. Such an approach might induce him to disclose more of
his own feelings. The &quot;I&quot; messages and active listening methods she would use
would tend to personalize their communication sufficiently but not to a degree that would
be uncomfortable for him. </p>

<p>Finally, she might ask him to design a program for improving communication generally in
the department. In so doing, he would become a resident specialist in it and a thus a
deputy with special status. </p>
