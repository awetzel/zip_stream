<p>This section skips the general introductory information and formal course materials and
goes directly to sections of the training program which deal with the diagnosis and
treatment of particular conflict problems. If you find the material presented in the
questions or the answers to be confusing, or if you want to learn more about the
constructive confrontation approach to intractable conflicts, go to the &quot;<a
href="approach.htm">theoretical approach</a>&quot; section to learn why the information is
organized as it is, and how the approach presented here differs from other common
approaches to conflict problems.</p>

<p>The links below take you to lists of common conflict problems. Read through this list,
selecting those problems that you are interested in. By clicking on an item, you will see
a list of typical problems related to that topic.&nbsp; Each has a brief description, but
more information is available by clicking on the particular problem title.&nbsp; When you
do this,&nbsp; you will receive: 1) a more detailed description of the problem; 2) links
to actual examples of the problem; 3) a list of possible solutions to the problem; and 4)
links to closely related problems. You will get a similar list of choices if you go to the
solution list for a particular problem. In this case you will see a list of possible
solutions or treatments for each problem along with a two sentence description.&nbsp; When
you click on a solution you will receive: 1)&nbsp; a more detailed description; 2)
examples of&nbsp; how the solution has been implemented in an actual conflict situation;
and 3) see a list of other problems that this solution helps deal with. </p>

<p>The problems, solutions, and examples offered here are not intended to be a complete
list of available approaches for dealing with these problems. Rather, we see them as
things to think about and a starting point which the parties can use to develop their own
creative solutions. We plan to continue to add new ideas to this system as time and
funding allows. <em>If readers have an idea to contribute, click on the
&quot;contact&quot; button on the bottom of any page--we want to hear from you!</em></p>

<h3>Organization of the Problem and Treatment Lists</h3>

<p>The problems in these problem and treatment lists are divided into three parts. &nbsp;
The first part involves problem definition--defining what the conflict is about (framing),
who is involved, and what the context of the conflict is (scoping). Without an accurate
understanding of the people and/or issues involved and how the conflict relates to other
situations (past and present) it is very hard to confront any conflict in an effective
way. </p>

<p>The second part looks at complicating factors that often make conflicts worse than they
really should be and make them difficult to handle constructively, even if one takes care
of all of the problems discussed earlier. These complicating factors include communication
problems, fact-finding problems, procedural problems, and escalation.</p>

<p>The third part involves confrontation strategies. People involved in conflicts can do
one of two things. They can withdraw from the conflict, or they can confront it in some
way. When they confront it, they are trying to influence the situation in a way which will
benefit themselves. They may do so by using force; they may try to trade or negotiate; or
they may try to persuade the opponent to change his or her attitudes and/or behavior
voluntarily (using what we call &quot;integrative strategies&quot;). Sections address each
of these three fundamental approaches, as well as combination strategies which combine two
or more of these fundamental types of approaches (force, exchange, or integrative
strategies).</p>

<h2>Problem Categories</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="!overlay_problems.htm#framing">Framing</a> - Problems defining what the
    conflict is about and how it is to be addressed.</li>
  <li><a href="!overlay_problems.htm#SCOPING">Scoping</a> - Problems defining who else is
    involved, what they think, and the context or the environment of the conflict.</li>

<h3>Ways to Use This System (How to find your way around the system.)</h3>

<p>There are many ways to use this resource. You may skip around from link to link reading
only those topics that are of direct interest to you or relevance to your immediate
situation. This enables you to &quot;customize&quot; the information you receive to match
your interests and needs. Or you may go straight through, reading most or all of the
information on all of the entries. While this takes much a longer time, it gives a much
better overview of the nature of intractable conflicts in general and how they can be
approached in more constructive ways.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To simplify programming, it is often necessary to go back to the previous screen to get
the menu of other choices.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this use the &quot;go back&quot; arrow on
your browser.&nbsp; You can also use the menu bar if you selected it at the opening
screen.</p>
