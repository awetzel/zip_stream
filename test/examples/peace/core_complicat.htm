<h1 align="center">Core Conflict and Complicating Factors</h1>

<hr>

<p>We find it useful to distinguish between two parts of a conflict: the core conflict and
the complicating factors. The core conflict involves the basic things that the conflict is
about --the incompatible interests, the unmet needs, the fundamental value differences, or
the struggle for justice. The complicating factors are the extra issues and problems that
occur as the conflict goes on that makes dealing with the core conflict more difficult.
These include problems with conflict definition (disagreements about what the conflict is
really about); misunderstandings, fact-finding problems, decision making procedural
problems, and escalation. Each of these complicating factors tends to intensify or obscure
the core conflict, making it harder to deal with effectively. Even when the core conflict
is highly resistant to resolution, by limiting (or even eliminating) most of the
complicating factors it is possible to deal with the remaining conflict in a much more
constructive way. For this reason, our approach focuses on defining the conflict in terms
of core and complicating factors, and then considering what incremental changes can be
made in each to make the conflict more constructive.</p>

<p>Click here to see a diagram which further illustrates the relationship between the core
conflict and complicating factors.</p>

<p>**INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE!***</p>

<p>Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the core conflict and the complicating
factors. The core conflict is shown in the center. Over that lie two layers of
complicating factors. The first is conflict definition problems. (This is sometimes
referred to as &quot;framing&quot; problems as people define a conflict by putting a
&quot;frame&quot; around a particular part of it, thereby focusing on that part.) The way
the disputants define it as a relatively simple difference of interests or a
misunderstanding, they will probably be able to deal with it relatively easily. If they
define it as a fundamental moral disagreement, or an issue of justice, or personal
identity or pride, it is likely to be more difficult to resolve. Similarly, conflicts that
are defined as negotiable probably will be, while conflicts that are seen to involve
non-negotiable needs or values may be considerably more difficult to resolve.</p>

<p>The outer layer then contains four other complicating factors. These are the ones
listed above: misunderstandings, fact-finding problems, procedural problems, and
escalation. On the top circle, these complicating factors are unlimited--in other words,
they are not being controlled. When complicating factors are allowed to build up, they can
become so &quot;thick&quot; that they completely obscure the core conflict. In the lower
circle, the complicating factors have been controlled, though they have not been
eliminated. Nevertheless, the complicating factors are much less overwhelming, and it is
much easier to see through them down to the core. A significant part of constructive
confrontation involves methods of identifying complicating factors, and implementing
techniques to limit these factors, so that attention can be better focused on the core
issues.</p>
