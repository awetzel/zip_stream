<p>This figure illustrates the relationship between an imaginary dispute between two
ethnic groups in a post-colonial society named Dufountain. The two groups in this
hypothetical country as the &quot;Duists&quot; and the &quot;Fountists.&quot; Time runs
from left to right. Each of the sets of fat arrows represents one short-term conflict, or
as the chart calls it, a &quot;dispute.&quot; In this illustration, eight disputes occur.
The first two result in improved policies for the Duists (show by the solid black arrows
going up toward the top of the page). The next two do not change the relative situations
for either group (thus the black arrows go straight across the page). Then disputes five,
six, and seven result in outcomes that are less favorable to the Duists, but more
favorable to the Fountists. None of the disputes resolves the long-term, underlying
conflict; the dispute settlements only alter social policies <em>for a time</em> in a way
that favors one group more than another. Whenever the losing group believes that it has
gained enough power to prevail in a later dispute, it will most likely try again to engage
the opponent and force an outcome that is more favorable to them than the dispute outcome
was. For this reason, dispute settlement is not the same thing as conflict resolution. One
is a temporary settlement of an immediate problem; the other is a long-term settlement of
an underlying long-running conflict.</p>

<p>While this training program is useful for all kinds of conflicts and disputes, it is
primarily designed to help people better deal with highly resolution resistant conflicts.
Thus, while we will touch lightly on techniques for resolving simpler disputes, our
emphasis will be on the management, or what we call &quot;constructive confrontation: of
intractable or resolution-resistant conflicts.</p>

<p>For more information on the differences between short term disputes and long term
conflicts, see Burton, 1990 and Burton and Dukes, 1990.</p>
