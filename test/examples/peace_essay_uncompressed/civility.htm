<p>The increasingly vocal campaign for civility in public discourse reflects an
understandable and widespread frustration with the current tenor of political debate.
There is a growing realization that our inability to deal with broad range of problems is
largely attributable to the destructive ways in which the issues are being addressed. This
raises a crucial and increasingly controversial question--what exactly do we mean by
&quot;civility&quot;? </p>

<p>Clearly, civility has to mean something more that mere politeness. The movement will
have accomplished little if all it does is get people to say, &quot;excuse me
please&quot;, while they (figuratively) stab you in the back. Civility also cannot mean
&quot;roll over and play dead.&quot; People need to be able to raise tough questions and
present their cases when they feel their vital interests are being threatened. A civil
society cannot avoid tough but important issues, simply because they are unpleasant to
address. There must also be more to civility than a scrupulous adherence to the laws
governing public-policy decision making. Clearly, there are numerous instances in which
the parties to public-policy conflicts act in ways which are destructive and
inappropriate, even though they are (and should continue to be) legal. </p>

<p>In short, any reasonable definition of civility must recognize that the many differing
interests which divide our increasingly diverse society will produce an endless series of
confrontations over difficult moral and distributional issues. Often these issues will
have an irreducible win-lose character and, hence, not be amenable to consensus
resolution. While continuing confrontation is inevitable, the enormous destructiveness
which commonly accompanies these confrontations is not. </p>

<p>In our work at the University of Colorado's Conflict Research Consortium, we have been
developing an approach which we call &quot;constructive confrontation.&quot; This approach
combines an understanding of conflict processes, dispute resolution, and advocacy
strategies to help disputants better advance their interests. In addition to explaining
why the politeness embodied in conventional definitions of &quot;civility&quot; is
important, we also identify a number of other areas in which adversaries, decision makers,
and those caught in the middle can work individually and collectively to increase the
constructiveness of public debate. Examples of these areas include: </p>

<p><strong>Separating People from the Problem</strong> </p>

<p>First, and most obviously, is a commitment to civility in the traditional and
relatively narrow sense of the word. People need to recognize that other thoughtful and
caring people have very different views on how best to address their community's many
complex problems. Constructive debate needs to focus on solutions which are most likely to
be successful, and not upon personal attacks leveled by adversaries against one another.
This is summed up by Roger Fisher, Bill Ury and Bruce Patton, authors of the <em>New York
Times</em> best-seller<em> Getting to Yes,</em> who advise disputants to &quot;separate
the people from the problem.&quot; When this is not done, conflicts tend to escalate so
much that key decisions are made on the basis of very personal, &quot;us vs. them&quot;
animosities rather than the relative merits of competing problem-solving strategies. </p>

<p><strong>Obtain Available Technical Facts</strong> </p>

<p>Many public policy disputes involve factual disagreements which are amenable to
resolution through some type of fact-finding process. Failure to discern available facts
substantially increases the probability that the situation will be so misunderstood that
the solutions adopted will fail to achieve the desired results. Constructive civil debate,
therefore, requires that the parties work together to resolve factual disagreements
wherever possible. There are, of course, many cases in which factual issues can't be
resolved because of irreducible uncertainties associated with the limits of scientific
inquiry. When, this is true, contending parties need to publically explain the reasoning
behind their differing interpretations of the factual information which is available. </p>

<p><strong>Limit Interpersonal Misunderstandings</strong> </p>

<p>Often the adversaries proceed on the basis of very inaccurate (and usually
unjustifiably evil) images of the interests, positions, and actions of others. Civility
requires that contending parties make an honest and continuing effort to understand the
views and reasoning of their opponents. The community needs to condemn the deliberate
distortion of information and the presentation of unbalanced views as unacceptable. </p>

<p><strong>Use Fair Processes</strong> </p>

<p>Civility also requires that the public issues be addressed by a process that is fair in
both appearance and fact. Public input needs to be honestly solicited and considered.
Decisions also need to be made on the basis of substantive arguments. For example,
advocates of the status quo should not be able to prevail by simply introducing endless
procedural delays which prevent alternative proposals from being considered or acted upon.
</p>

<p><strong>Limit Escalation</strong></p>

<p>The most destructive confrontation process, escalation, arises when accidental or
intentional provocations beget greater counter-provocations in an intensifying cycle that
transforms a substantive debate characterized by honest problem solving into one in which
mutual hatred becomes the primary motive. De-escalation and escalation avoidance
strategies are needed to limit this problem.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Honor Legitimate Uses of Legal, Political, and Other Types of Power. </strong></p>

<p>Public policy disputes involve issues which people feel very strongly about. Given
this, disputing parties can be expected to use all of the powers available to them in an
attempt to prevail. In our political system this means that people are entitled to use the
legal and political system to advance their interests. We should respect this right and
not attempt to require that the parties renounce their power options as a precondition for
discussion.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Separate Win/Win from Win/Lose Issues</strong> </p>

<p>Wherever possible, the parties should try to reframe the conflict in ways which
transform win-lose confrontations into win-win opportunities. In cases where this is not
possible, the parties need to recognize and accept the fact that political and legal
institutions will repeatedly be called upon to make the tough choices.</p>

<p><strong>Limit the Backlash Effect</strong> </p>

<p>While political, legal or other types of force may produce short term victory, they
also tend to generate a powerful backlash. People hate to be forced to do things against
their will and can be expected to launch a &quot;counterattack&quot; at the earliest
opportunity. The best way to limit this backlash effect is for parties to take positions
which can be justified on the basis of broadly acceptable principles of fairness which all
members of society have an interest in supporting. While such justifications cannot be
expected to convert all opponents, they can be expected to increase the parties' base of
support by attracting some opponents as well as a larger number of &quot;middle of the
roaders.&quot; This emphasis upon the justification tends to produce more reasonable
positions on both sides while making it more difficult for contending parties to pursue
purely selfish objectives. </p>

<p><strong>Keep Trying to Persuade and Allow Yourself to be Persuaded</strong></p>

<p>One crucial element of civility is recognition by conflicting parties that it is
possible that they are wrong and that the policies advocated by their opponents are
actually better. This entails an obligation to seriously consider the persuasive arguments
made by opponents and to carefully try to explain and justify one's own position to one's
opponents and others. </p>

<p><strong>More Persuasion, More Exchange, Less force </strong></p>

<p>The best ways to produce stable, long-term policy change is through persuasion in which
parties are converted to their opponent's point of view, or through exchange through which
the parties negotiate mutually beneficial win-win trade-offs. This implies that the use of
force should be minimized wherever possible. </p>
