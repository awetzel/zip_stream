<p><em>Stephen Ryan, &quot;Peace-keeping and Peace-making,&quot;chapt. in Ethnic Conflict
and International Relations, (Dartmouth: Dartmouth Publishing, 1995), pp. 101-128.</em></p>

<p>Ryan examines cases of failed peace-building and peace-making. Ryan defines peace-
building as &quot;the practical implementation of peaceful social change through
socio-economic reconstruction and development.&quot;[p. 102] Effective peace-building will
also make use of strategies aimed at changing parties' attitudes. Ryan finds that the
attitudes of ordinary people play an important role the success or failure of
peace-building activities. Peace-making refers to political and diplomatic activity aimed
at reconciling perceived conflicts of interests. Peace- making may involve negotiation,
arbitration, mediation and conciliation. Peace-building and peace-keeping are not likely
to be effective without effective peace-making. </p>

<p>Failed Peace-Building </p>

<p>Peace-building efforts can fail when the leaders move toward peace too quickly, before
their constituents are ready. This occurred in Sri Lanka. In 1957 the Sinhalese Prime
Minister signed an agreement with the Tamil minority granting them limited autonomy in
language education and territory. The agreement sparked a violent backlash from the
Sinhalese community, and the Prime Minister was assassinated in 1959. The agreement was
abandoned. Similar popular opposition undermined peace agreements in 1960, and again in
1969. </p>

<p>In the early 1970s the British government took direct rule of Northern Ireland. The
British planned to gradually transfer power back to Northern Ireland, and to establish a
new Northern Ireland Parliament based on a system of proportional representation.
Proportional representation would guarantee a number of assembly seats to the Catholic
minority. While the Protestant leadership was willing to try the plan, the Ulster Workers'
Council (an association of Protestant workers) was able to derail the plan through a
campaign of intimidation and direct industrial action. </p>

<p>In 1990, the Bulgarian government made unilateral initiatives to the country's ethnic
Turk population design to ease their plight. The prompted a popular backlash. Bulgarian
nationalists staged mass demonstrations, and formed Committees for the Defense of the
National Interest. Popular opposition forced the government to back away from some of
their concessions. </p>

<p>Ineffective Peace-Making</p>

<p>Cyprus demonstrates the result of inadequate peace-making. Between 1968 and 1974
peace-keeping forces had been successful at controlling violence and creating security in
Cyprus. However, there was no resolution of the basic issues of contention during that
period, and the two sides to the conflict remained suspicious of each other. In 1974
violence resumed with a Greek sponsored coup and a Turkish invasion. </p>

<p>Effective peace-keeping requires that all the significant parties to the conflict
desire to avoid violence. When peace-making fails, peace-keeping activities face
unattractive options. In Rwanda the failure of peace-making left peace-keeping forces
passive in the face of Rwandan violence. The failure of peace-making in Cyprus left
peace-keeping forces faced with the task of perpetual conflict maintenance. Failed
peace-making may also lead peace-keeping forces to become more deeply involved in the
fighting. This has happened to the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka, and to UN
peace-keeping forces in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
