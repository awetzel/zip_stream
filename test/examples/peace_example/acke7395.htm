<h1>The Principles of Strategic Nonviolent Conflict</h1>

<em>

<p>&quot;The Principles of Strategic Nonviolent Conflict,&quot; chapt. in Strategic
Nonviolent Conflict, (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 1994), p. 21-53.</em></p>

<p>Ackerman and Kruegler suggest twelve principles of strategic action. Each principle
addresses a factor in the success or failure of strategic nonviolent conflict. The authors
note that adhering to these principles may increase the likelihood of success, but cannot
guarantee it. They also expect these principles to undergo revision and refinement as our
understanding of strategies of nonviolence grows.</p>

<p>The first five principles concentrate on creating conditions conducive to strategic
nonviolence. First, the group must formulate clear, well-defined, functional goals. Such
goals must be achievable within a realistic time frame, and must be amenable to nonviolent
action. The goals should reflect the group's vital interests and have widespread support.
Goals which draw support from outside the group are also helpful.</p>

<p>Second, the group must develop organizational strength at each level of the
organization: in the leadership, the operational corps, and the general population. In
order to successfully employ nonviolent strategies the group must be able to hide members
and resources, to disperse resources, and to surprise the opponent. They will need to make
decisions under pressure. They must be able to garner support, and implement their
decisions.</p>

<p>Third, the group must secure access to material resources. Adequate food, energy, and
medical supplies can be key in maintaining morale. They must also secure the relevant
offensive resources, such as photocopiers or fax machines. Ackerman and Kruegler caution
against allowing control of resources to become a goal in itself. </p>

<p>The fourth principle is to cultivate sources of external support. External sympathy and
support can be very helpful in achieving the first three principles. The group should also
seek to undermine their adversary's support. </p>

<p>The fifth principle is to seek to expand the group's repertoire of strategic nonviolent
actions. Flexibility and versatility are key to success. When choosing a particular form
of action the group should consider which action will help it to seize the initiative,
whether the action could be easily duplicated elsewhere in the struggle, how much training
and preparation the action will require and what its risk-impact balance is. The group
should seek actions which &quot;are likely to build momentum and maximize the adverse
impact on the opponents while preserving flexibility.&quot;[p. 35]</p>

<p>The next set of principles focuses on engaging with the opponent. Principle six directs
groups to attack their opponent's strategy for maintaining control and obedience. The more
difficult it is for the opponent to control their own forces, the more difficult it will
be for them to attack or even oppose the nonviolent group.</p>

<p>Seventh, the group should seek to minimize the impact of the opponent's use of
violence. Being subject to violence can be demoralizing, and can feed the desire to
respond violently. When possible, the group should try to get out of harm's way. Groups
may try to limit the violence by disabling the adversary's weapons, or by suborning the
adversary's troops. When violence does occur, it is important that group members be
psychologically prepared for it, and that support systems for victims and families are in
place. </p>

<p>Eighth, groups should use the adversary's own actions to alienate the adversary's
supporters. Publicizing the adversaries attempts at repression, especially violent
repression of nonviolent resistors, often alienates their support. </p>

<p>Principle nine stresses the need to maintain nonviolent discipline. The authors note
that &quot;when nonviolent protagonists maintain discipline, they not only delegitimize
the opponents' violence, but they also gain credibility, stature, and, ultimately,
power.&quot; By breaking discipline and engaging in acts of violence the group undermines
its own credibility, and risks removing any restraint the adversary might have felt in
dealing with the group. A strong sense of discipline can also reinforce morale, and help
the group to weather violence.</p>

<p>The remaining principles focus on understanding the ongoing conflict. The tenth
principle directs planners to pay attention to the five different levels of strategic
planning and decision making. These are the levels of policy, operation, strategy, tactics
and logistics. While it is important to keep a comprehensive overview of the nonviolent
strategy in mind, planners must also be aware of the particular issues which arise at the
various levels of an operation. </p>

<p>Eleventh, the nonviolent strategist should &quot;adjust offensive and defensive
operations according to the relative vulnerabilities of the
protagonists.&quot;(opponents)[p. 48] Offensive actions undermine an opponent's ability to
stay in the fight. Defensive actions protect a group's own ability to stay in the fight.
Planners must be aware of where their actions lie on the offensive-defensive spectrum, and
be prepared to shift along that spectrum as new vulnerabilities present themselves.</p>

<p>Twelfth and finally, strategists must match their choice of nonviolent action to not
only their goal, but also to match the desired mechanism whereby the opponent eventually
accedes to that goal. These are four general mechanisms by which the adversary may
capitulate. They may be converted to the group's way of thinking. They may choose to
accommodate the group's demands rather than continue the conflict. They may have become
unable to continue the fight, and so be coerced. Or the adversary may have been
disintegrated by the conflict, and so no longer exist to oppose the group's demands.</p>
