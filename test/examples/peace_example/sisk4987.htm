<em>

<p>Timothy D. Sisk, Power Sharing and International Mediation in Ethnic Conflicts,
(Washington, D.C.:United States Institute of Peace, 1996). </em></p>

<p>In his introductory chapter, Sisk argues that the creation of sovereign states for
every ethnic group currently demanding self-determination is impractical, if not
impossible. Instead, demands for autonomy must be met within the political organization of
existing states. The key to managing ethnic conflicts, then, is to develop power sharing
political systems which can accommodate group demands for self-determination. In
subsequent chapters Sisk explores the nature of ethnic conflicts, describes various types
of power-sharing political systems, and investigates the international community's role in
promoting such power sharing.</p>

<p>Chapter Two discuses some of the general features of ethnic conflicts. Ethnic conflicts
will be easier to manage if the participants perceive their differences to be socially
constructed, rather than innate and immutable. Conflicts will be less severe when there is
some social, cultural or economic overlap between the groups. The relation of the state to
the conflicting ethnic groups is also an important factor in the severity of the conflict.
Ethnic outbidding is a common feature of ethnic conflicts. Would-be group leaders dismiss
moderates as sellouts, and attempt to outbid each other with increasingly extreme
positions. Sisk understands ethnic conflict escalation as the product of ongoing ethnic
tension and precipitating events. De- escalation is best managed through protracted
negotiations after the conflict has reached stalemate. </p>

<p>Chapter Three discuses the various forms that democracy can take in ethnically divided
states. Sisk argues that democratic approaches offer the most promise for the long term
management of ethnic conflict. Simple majority rule is not an effective form of democracy
for ethnically divided societies. It simply disenfranchises minorities. Democratic forms
which emphasize power-sharing show more promise. &quot;Power sharing political systems are
those that foster governing coalitions inclusive of most, if not all, major mobilized
ethnic groups in society.&quot;[p. 4] Sisk discusses two forms of power-sharing democracy.
In consociational democracies ethnic groups are treated analogously to confederated
states. Groups have internal autonomy, and group leaders negotiate amongst themselves to
manage conflict. Integrative democracies seek to encourage moderation in group leaders and
to encourage intergroup cooperation at all levels of government. </p>

<p>Each approach to democracy has its characteristic techniques for managing conflicts.
Chapter Four describes these techniques. Consociational techniques include granting groups
territorial autonomy, employing proportional representation in administrative appointments
and parliamentary elections, and recognizing group rights. Integrative techniques focus on
creating a unitary, inclusive central state. This approach relies on ethnically neutral
majoritarian decision-making, &quot;ethnicity-blind&quot; public policies, and adoption of
an electoral system which encourages political and ethnic coalitions.</p>

<p>Chapter Five describes the factors which motivate conflicting groups to consider peace
through power sharing. Generally, groups must be motivated by the fear of continuing or
increasing violence. Power sharing is most likely to succeed where the groups have
internal unity and organization, and where there is broad and deep support for peace. </p>

<p>In Chapter Six, Sisk explores the role of the international community in promoting and
supporting power sharing approaches to managing ethnic conflicts. Sisk first notes that
while there are often substantial problems with partitioning existing states, the creation
of a separate state cannot be rejected out of hand. He also observes that the
international community tends to overemphasize the usefulness of democratic elections in
regulating ethnic conflicts. Elections can further polarize groups. The timing of
international intervention is also a delicate matter. If the intervention is too early the
parties may lack motivation to settle; if too late their animosity may be too deep to
overcome. Generally the international community has intervened by offering conflicting
parties blueprints for power sharing political systems, and linking adoption of those
systems to various other issues. Those linkages serve as incentives and sanctions. Sisk
notes that promoting a power sharing solution often involves taking sides in the conflict.
</p>

<p>Sisk concludes the text by observing that there is no simple formula governing
successful power sharing arrangements. Power sharing techniques may be useful even in the
absence of a larger democratic political system. However, the author does identify four
general conditions which favor power sharing as a successful solution to ethnic conflicts.
First, moderate group leaders who have the general support of their groups accept power
sharing arrangements. Second, the arrangements are not externally imposed. Third, power
sharing arrangements provide for equitable distribution of resources. Finally, extreme
elements of the initial arrangements can be gradually replaced with more integrative,
liberal democratic arrangements.</p>
