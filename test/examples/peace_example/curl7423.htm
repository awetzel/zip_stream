<p><em>Adam Curle,&quot;Antidote to Alienation,&quot; chap. in Another Way: Positive
response to contemporary violence,&quot; (Oxford: Jon Carpenter Publishing, 1995), pp.
109-142<big><big>.</big></big></em></p>

Curle discusses the Center for Peace, Nonviolence, and Human Rights in Osijek, Croatia and
argues that it offers a model for dealing with modern sources of violence. Curle argues
that much modern violence stems from peoples' alienation from their societies and from
their sense of common humanity. Traditional forms of peacemaking, which focus on relative
power, intervention, state's rights, diplomacy and negotiation, are not adequate
approaches to the violence of alienation. To be effective, peacemaking must focus on
restoring and preserving a sense of relatedness among people. </p>

<p>The Osijek Center was founded by a pair of local peace activists in 1992. By 1994 it
had an active core membership of fifty people, mostly women. The founding members were
concerned not only with the physical damage caused by the war, but also with the
psychological damage. The people of Osijek, they found, were increasingly prone to
demonize the enemy and to accept &quot;the logic of war as the sole means of
survival.&quot;[p. 115] The central goal of the Center is to &quot;both stimulate and
preserve the values on which harmony can eventually be restored.&quot;[p. 129] The main
task of the Center was originally conceived as education. As the center became known
publicly, it began to attract reports of human rights violations, and so its focus
expanded. When Serb townspeople were threatened with illegal evictions by the Croatian
military, Center members used nonviolent confrontation to protect them. The Center also
provides legal counsel, and trains human rights officers. Center members have persevered
in the face of threats. Center educational programs include training in nonviolent action
for social change, and programs to help teachers heal their own war trauma, in order to
then better help others. The Center also has a variety of programs designed to help
refugees, such as a market gardening project, and sewing classes for women. These programs
combine psychological healing with economic opportunities. The Center has established
relations with other, international organizations and human rights groups, and is seeking
ways to communicate with neighboring Serb territories. </p>
