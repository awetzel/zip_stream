<h2>The Power of Moral Suasion in International Mediation</h2>

<p>by Eileen Babbit</p>

<em>

<p>Selection from: </em>Eileen Babbit<em>, </em>&quot;Jimmy Carter:&nbsp; The Power of
Moral Suasion in International Mediation&quot;&nbsp; in Deborah Kolb, ed.<em>, When Talk
Works, </em>(San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1994), pp. 378-388<em>.</em></p>

<p>President Carter uses trust and personal relationships, as well as moral power and
emotion, to prevent negotiations from breaking down during Camp David. </p>

<p>When Sadat threatened to leave the summit, Carter met with him privately. Carter
explained to Sadat that by withdrawing Sadat would be breaking his personal promise to
Carter. Leaving would also damage the trust and friendship between them personally.
Withdrawing at that point would also damage the relationship between their nations. By
emphasizing the value of trust and friendship, as well as the moral value of a promise,
Carter persuaded Sadat to remain.</p>

<p>As talks threatened to break down at the last minute, Carter made skillful use of
personal relationships and emotions to reassure and recommit Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin to the talks. Carter made a personal visit to Begin, bringing him
photographs which Carter had autographed with the names of each of Begin's grandchildren.
The gesture moved Begin deeply. The two men shared a personal discussion about their
grandchildren, and about war. </p>
