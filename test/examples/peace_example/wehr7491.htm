<p>While the US civil rights movement, to our knowledge, never engaged in a formal
inventory of their power resources, some of the leaders of the movement did. In its
primary conflict group, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Jim Lawson
and Bob Moses reflected on, then committed themselves to power elements they believed
would be most effective for mobilizing large numbers of Americans, black and white, for
racial justice.&nbsp; Lawson found moral power to be the movement's paramount resource.
That power resided in the ideology, strategy and tactics of disciplined nonviolent action.
His ability to produce thousands of trained and committed nonviolent actionists who filled
the jails to resist segregation in the 1960s was responsible for much movement success.
His nonviolence strategizing in the Nashville Christian Leadership Conference produced the
most persistent and disciplined sit-in movement in the nation (Branch 1988, 274).
Nonviolence both confounded segregation and engaged potential supporters. It was a
wellspring of power. &nbsp; Moses saw legal power as the movement's primary resource. The
civil right to vote and registering southern Blacks to claim that right were the focus of
his movement work (Branch 1988, 331). This was perhaps the most sacred right to Americans.
Action of blacks to exercise it would engage both federal enforcement and citizen approval
everywhere. It would also make Blacks a political force in local, state and national
politics. The strategic decision to target voting rights and doggedly pursue them would
have important consequences for the civil rights movement (McAdam 1982). </p>
