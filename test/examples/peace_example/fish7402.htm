<p ALIGN="left">The first rule of principled negotiation is separating relationship issues
(or &quot;people problems&quot;) from substantive issues, and dealing with them
independently. One kind of &quot;people problem&quot; they discuss is what we call framing
problems-the problem that people see or define a situation differently, depending on who
they are and what their situation is. In the 1991 edition of Getting to Yes (which added
Bruce Patton as a third author), they list seven ways for handling what they call
&quot;problems of perception&quot; and what we call &quot;framing problems.&quot; These
are as follows:</p>

<p>First, try to see the situation from your opponent's perspective. You do not have to
agree with their perceptions of the situation. But it is important to understand what they
think and feel, and why they think and feel as they do.</p>

<p>Second, don't deduce your opponent's intentions from your own fears. It is common to
assume that your opponent plans to do just what you fear they will do. This sort of
suspicious attitude makes it difficult to accurately perceive your opponent's real
intentions; whatever they do you will assume the worst.</p>

<p>Third, avoid blaming your opponent for the problem. Blame, even if it is deserved, will
only make your opponent defensive. Even worse, your opponent may attack you in response.
Blame is generally counterproductive.</p>

<p>Fourth, discuss each other's perceptions. Explicit discussion of each side's
perceptions will help both sides to better understand each other (see the first point).
And discussion will help each side to avoid projecting their fears onto one another (see
the third point). Also, such discussion may reveal shared perceptions. Acknowledging
shared perceptions can strengthen the parties' relationship, and facilitate productive
negotiations.</p>

<p>Fifth, seek opportunities to act inconsistently with your opponent's misperceptions.
That is, try to disappoint your opponent's worst beliefs and expectations about you. Just
as it is important for you to have an accurate perception of your opponent, it is also
important for them to have an accurate perception of you. Disappointing your opponent's
negative or inaccurate beliefs will help to change those beliefs.</p>

<p>Sixth, give your opponent a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the
negotiation process. If your opponent does not feel involved in the negotiation process,
then they are unlikely to feel involved in its outcome. Conversely, if they feel that the
process is in part their process, then they are more likely to accept its conclusion as
their conclusion.</p>

<p>Seventh, make your proposals consistent with the principles and self-image of your
opponent. All the parties to a negotiation need to be able to reconcile the agreement with
their principles and self-image. That is, they need to feel the final agreement does not
compromise their integrity. Proposals which are consistent with your opponent's principles
and which do not undermine their self-image are more likely to be accepted. </p>
