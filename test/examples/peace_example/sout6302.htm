<em>

<p>&quot;South Africa's Bumpy Road to Democracy&quot;. Peace Watch, Vol.1, No. 4. June
1995. United States Institute of Peace, Washington</em>, D.C. Pp. 6-7.</p>

<p>This article is dedicated to the one year anniversary of South Africa's first
democratic elections, which took place on April 27, 1994. Nelson Mandela became president
as a result of the elections. His approach was to create a nonracial democracy, as opposed
to multiracialism. The difference between these two approaches is that multiracialism
emphasizes diversity but fails to unite people, while nonracial democracy respects
diversity but values unity. This unity can be achieved only through bringing the truth
about the past to light. In South Africa this is done through a &quot;committee that
investigates crimes and promotes reconciliation..., as well as an affirmative action
program&quot; (p. 7).</p>

<p>After the excitement of the fall of apartheid and the beginning of the democratization
process, it was time to start dealing with the many problems that exist in the society,
such as the dissatisfaction of black people with the government trying to win whites'
favor, black people's expectations for quick improvement in their standards of living, an
increase in violent crimes and social disorder. Thus, after the excitement declined, deep
racial and class differences became apparent. To deal with conflict situations, the
National Peace Accord (1991) created a number of peace committees at all levels. Recently
the government decided to dismantle conflict resolution organs; many believe that this was
done too soon. The action was explained by the belief that democratic institutions can
take responsibility for dealing with conflicting issues. But people working in the area of
conflict management worry that democracy is not strong enough to fulfill those tasks. They
think that the Peace Accord should be revised to respond to new social conditions, but
divisions in the society are still very deep and need serious attention. But at the same
time, the view of the future is optimistic. First, blacks and whites understand that the
success of the democracy depends on their cooperation. Second, South Africa has a
leadership respected by different layers of the society. Third, both the leaders and the
people have high respect for democratic values. It was the Peace Accord that created
channels for democratic ways of managing problems in South Africa, and encouraged
political groups to adopt those methods. </p>
