<h1>Disputes Yield When 'Ripe'</h1>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Disputes Yield When 'Ripe.'&quot; Consensus. Published by the Public Disputes
Network. November 1988. No.1. P. 5.</p>

<p>According to the evaluation of three cases of mediation of conflicts between electric
utilities, regulatory agencies, and environmental and consumer groups in New Mexico,
Colorado and Massachusetts by Technical Development Corporation (TDC),
&quot;ripeness&quot; of a dispute plays a major role in successful conflict resolution.
Dispute is ripe when (1) the parties come to the realization that potential gains from
negotiation are greater than those from other alternatives; (2) the position of regulatory
authority toward negotiation and the way it will treat potential agreement in its decision
making should be clear from the beginning; and (3) parties should be certain that all
necessary resources (time, personnel, and money) will be provided for negotiation. </p>
