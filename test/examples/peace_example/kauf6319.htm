No. 2. Pp. 9-10.</em> </p>

<p>Craig Kauffman explores the situation in Nicaragua after the coalition government of
Violetta Chamorro came to power in 1990. A lot of hopes were associated with Chamorro's
government. She was able to reconcile different groups of the United Nicaraguan Opposition
and it was expected that she would be able to satisfy divergent interests of the
Nicaraguan populace. The results were rather disappointing. If ideological differences
between the people are withering away and do not encourage conflict, new reasons for
conflict have emerged. There is a growing distrust of the leaders among the common people
and a dangerous separation between these two class groups. People believe that the leaders
failed in economic rebuilding of the country and care only about their personal gains. </p>

<p>There are a lot of military groups operating in the rural areas of the country. They
rearmed themselves and resorted to violence mainly to fulfill their
&quot;financial/survival needs&quot; (p. 9). Nicaraguans themselves explain this as a
&quot;cultural trait&quot;, which author believes consists of two elements. First,
Nicaraguans have a long history of being abused by the government, which has been robbing
the people of the fruits of their labor for many years. People were not able to develop
incentives for working for the distant future and preferred to pursue short-term personal
interests. Second, for many Nicaraguans being in a military group was a way to earn their
living. It led to the absence among the young generation of agricultural and technical
skills necessary for returning to peaceful life. Due to a lack of government assistance,
those young people prefer to stay in the resistance groups, which now do not fight for
ideological reasons but are involved in criminal activities to get money. The concept of
&quot;a conflict-habituated system&quot; developed by Dr. Louis Diamond is applicable to
the situation in Nicaragua. It implies that conflict became a part of the social structure
of the society. </p>

<p>But there is a hope: there are groups working on the transformation of this system
toward developing peaceful relationships and altering the social structures that encourage
violence. The Nueva Guinea Peace Commissions serve as an example. These commissions were
organized by citizens who wanted to stop violence. They played the major role in reducing
violence and disarming the Southern Front of the Contras by serving as a channel for
communication between the Contras and the Sandinista government. The Commissions' members
fulfill the following tasks: (1) serve as advocates for the victims of human rights
violations, investigating the cases of violence and providing authorities with the
information; (2) mediate between rearmed groups and the government, and in land ownership
disputes; (3) provide pastoral support through listening to and comforting the victims of
violence; (4) use moral force to convince all sides to stop human rights violations. The
appeal to humanity outside the political preferences and the state of anarchy existing in
the society made the warring parties more willing to respond and experience a sense of
satisfaction from doing something in the interests of the community, rather than for just
their personal gains. </p>

<p>The situation in Nicaragua is unstable. Although people are tired of war, the inability
of the government to develop effective economic policy and assist in transformation of
&quot;a conflict-habituated system&quot; could have dangerous consequences. Time will tell
if local Peace Commissions have enough strength to prevent the new conflict (based on
class differences) from developing. </p>
