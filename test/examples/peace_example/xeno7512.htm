<p>Nicholas Xenos, &quot;Refugees: The Modern Political Condition,&quot; Alternatives,
18:4 (Fall 1993), pp. 419-430.</p>

<p>Xenos explores the condition of being a refugee. He argues that the problem for
refugees is not so much that they are stateless, as that they are homeless. He then
examines the modern connection between having a state and having a home, and concludes
that the refugee problem is not primarily territorial; it is political.</p>

<p>A refugee, according to the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees, is any individual who is
outside their country and outside the protection of that country &quot;owing to a
well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality,
membership of a particular social groups or political opinion....&quot;[p. 421] The
Conventional definition focuses on individuals rather than groups, and political rather
than economic hardship. However, interpretation of this definition has varied widely
between nations, generally to suit the nation's own political concerns. During the Cold
War the western nations tended to accept anyone fleeing the Soviet sphere as a refugee.
The western nations did not insist on a case-by-case evaluation of the asylum seekers.
They also accepted refugees fleeing economic hardship, reasoning that the economic
conditions in Soviet bloc countries were politically imposed. Xenos points out that in
present times, &quot;would-be refugees from Third World countries who are deemed to be
escaping economic deprivation are rejected, which is a reflection of the view that market
economies are natural, not political arrangements.&quot;[p. 422] Nations have agreed to
accept refugees in exchange for economic assistance, and have used the outward flow of
refugees as a threat to coerce increased financial aid. Attempts to create a right to
asylum on the part of refugees have foundered against claims of state sovereignty.
&quot;All states treat absolute control of territory as an essential element to the claim
to sovereignty, so although governments are willing to consider agreements setting out the
normative terms for the treatment of persons fleeing the jurisdiction of other states, few
are willing to consider norms that would compromise their own territorial
control.&quot;[p. 422] While individuals have the right to flee their own nations, they do
not have the corresponding right to be taken in by any other nation.</p>

<p>Xenos argues that, in recent centuries, refugees have been the result of the formation
of modern nation-states. Nation-states form around not only a territory, but around a
particular national identity. Consolidating that national identity sometimes results in
the expulsion of dissenting or divergent populations. The process of ethnic cleansing is a
particularly horrible example of this process.</p>

<p>The author describes the refugee's condition as a type of homelessness. He argues that,
by the logic of the nation-state, people must leave their homes in order to come home;
they must sever their connection with whatever other community or communities to which
they belong in order to become members of the only community that counts the nation within
its own state.&quot;[p. 424]. Identification with the nation-state takes precedence over
membership in one's historical community of residence. Sometimes this means that people
are forced out of their homes and communities, in the name of being &quot;returned&quot;
to their homeland. The exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, India and
Pakistan, and Croatia and Bosnia are examples of this process. Peoples without a
nation-state homeland, such as the Gypsies or the Palestinians, are in constant danger of
being rendered homeless.</p>

<p>Xenos argues that the problem of refugees &quot;is a phenomena of the era of
nation-states and of the international political economy, and is a problem not insofar as
the refugee is denied a homeland but insofar as he or she is denied the possibility of
establishing a home.&quot;[p.427] Drawing on the works of other political theorists, Xenos
argues that individuals must have a home in order to take effective action in the world.
Having a home, that is, being rooted in a particular community, &quot;makes action
meaningful through shared understandings and a shared interpretation of action.&quot;[p.
427] Homes do not necessarily require a homeland to exist, and can be rebuilt when lost.
However, the present political equation between a home and a homeland does serve to deny
those who are stateless the ability to put down roots and build a home, and so denies them
the ability to be effective actors in the world.</p>

<p>Xenos concludes then that the problem of refugees is that they are denied the
possibility of building homes and establishing roots. He also points out that this problem
has a political cause. The problem does not stem from a shortage of land. Instead the
problem arises from certain modern notions of sovereignty and of the priority of the
nation-state, which deny refugees the political space to rebuild their homes. </p>
