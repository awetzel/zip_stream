<p>Wesborough, Massachusetts was a fast growing town. This growth created a concern among
its citizens about the effectiveness of the town government. This developed over the
decision of the Board of Selectmen not to re-appoint the Town Coordinator, who was
respected by the residents. A group, which assumed the name Citizens for Accountability,
believed that Don Cowles, recently elected selectman, had been responsible for the Board's
decision and wanted to recall him. A group against the recall became known as Pro-Cowles
Group. It argued that since someone was elected by the voters he had the right to serve
his three-year term. Both sides agreed that the problems were mounting for some time and
that this case brought them to light. The major issue was the system of appointing, which
the Citizens for Accountability believed needed improvement.</p>

<p>State Senator John Houston decided to intervene and suggested that the parties try
mediation. The goal of the mediators was to establish a new forum of communication for the
parties since existing channels (newspapers and meetings) only exacerbated the situation.
During the first session, parties criticized each other without any constructive
suggestions for improvement. To make mediation more effective, parties were asked to bring
specific proposals to the second meeting. While discussing the proposals, both sides
realized how much they had in common. They both wanted &quot;more accountability in the
process of their town's government.&quot; By the end of the mediation, parties established
guidelines for the work of the Board of Selectmen and &quot;agreed to work for approval of
a Town Charter Review,&quot; that would provide an opportunity to consider new appointment
options (p. 4). Parties worked together on collecting signatures to get the measure on the
ballot. </p>
