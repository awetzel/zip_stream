<p>Peachy, Dean. &quot;Thoughts on the Failure of Negotiations in the Gulf.&quot; Conflict
Resolution Notes. V. 8, No. 4. April 1991. Pp. 32-33.</em></p>

<p>Dean Peachy comes to two conclusions about the failure of negotiated solutions to the
conflict in the Gulf. According to him, it was either because the leaders were simply
incapable of constructive conflict management or that parties preferred force to
negotiations. The following facts made him think this way. (1) Economic sanctions were not
given enough time to produce an incentive for negotiations. Economic embargo is not a
technique capable of reversing the opponent's position, rather it pressures the other side
to engage in negotiations where solutions can be created. </p>

<p>(2) Negotiations presuppose separation of personalities and issues, and concentration
on interests rather than positions. Neither of these happened in this case. The Iraqi
leader was pronounced by American media the &quot;Butcher of Baghdad&quot; and the
American President was called by Iraqis the &quot;Great Satan in the White House.&quot;
Demonization prevented negotiations because the above perceptions mandated force as the
only appropriate method of dealing with the opponent. Secretary of State Baker, before
meeting with the Iraqi leader, stated that he was not going to negotiate with Hussein but
to demand compliance. Parties were focused on personalities rather than issues and
positions rather than interests.</p>

<p>Dean Peachy offers two plans for action for conflict resolution practitioners,
depending on the reasons for negotiation failure: (1) educate politicians in constructive
conflict management techniques and (2) make the public more aware of the danger of
resolving conflicts by force. </p>
