<h1>Nested&nbsp; Conflict: The Case of Ethiopia</h1>

<p><em>John Prendergast, &quot;The Nested Paradigm of Conflict Foci: The Case of
Ethiopia,&quot; sect. in Building Peace, by John Paul Lederach, (Washington, D.C.: United
States Institute of Peace, 1997), pp. 161-169. </em></p>

<p>Prendergast analyzes conflict in Ethiopia using Lederach's models of conflict and
peacebuilding. Ethiopia had been at civil war since the early 1960s. The Eritrean People's
Liberation Front (EPLF) secured independence for the Eritrean territory in the early
1990s. The remainder of Ethiopia is controlled by the EPRDF, a coalition group. Opposition
groups boycotted the elections which brought the current Ethiopian leadership into power.
Ethiopia is still subject to national tension and local conflicts. </p>

<p>Lederach adopts researcher Maire Dugan's nested foci paradigm for relating the
immediate issues within a conflict to the larger systemic aspects. Particular issues arise
within relationships, which exist within the larger context of subsystems, and ultimately
society-wide systems. Ethiopia exemplifies this nesting model, according to Prendergast.
Two issues contribute significantly to national tensions: the withdrawal of major
opposition parties from the electoral process, and the support for certain Ethiopian
opposition groups provided by radical Islamic groups in Sudan. International diplomatic
initiatives have focused on both these issues. </p>

<p>These issues arise within the context of historical ethnic relationships and rivalries
in Ethiopia. Local peace conferences have had some success in peacebuilding between ethnic
groups. Issues of gender equity have also been addressed at the relationship level. Fairly
specific local proposals which encourage gender equity are more likely to be implemented
than broad systemic reforms, which often conflict with local traditions. Ethiopian social
institutions have traditionally viewed conflict management as a matter of mending broken
relationships. Subsystemic and systemic factors contribute to conflict in Ethiopia.
Poverty, especially in the form of food insecurity, contributes to conflict in the region.
Resources generally are scarce in Ethiopia. Prendergast notes that &quot;the central role
of the state in determining resource distribution makes it a major target of, and--when
power is overcentralized--a major reason for, conflict.&quot;[p. 165] Peacebuilding
strategies have focused on reducing poverty, increasing food supplies, and decentralizing
government. The Ethiopian government has implemented a Green Revolution approach to
increasing farm yields and reducing poverty, with mixed results. The government is
attempting to decentralize along a model of ethnic federalism. This has contained what
would once have been national conflicts at the local level. However, the process of
drawing regional boundaries has been very contentious, and has occasionally prompted
violence.&nbsp;</p>
