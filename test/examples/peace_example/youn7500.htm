<p>Christopher Young, &quot;The Role of Media in International Conflict,&quot; Canadian
Institute for Peace and Security, Working Paper no. 38, (1991). </p>

<p>Young draws on discussions held during a two-day seminar in Ottawa, Canada to explore
some of the issues that the media face in covering military conflicts, and to examine
media roles in international conflict. </p>

<p>Security</p>

<p>There is an ongoing tension between journalists' desires to report on conflicts and
military actions, and military concerns about security. Generally journalists accept the
need for some secrecy regarding military maneuvers. However many journalists have observed
that &quot;secrecy and controls on reporters are often imposed for reasons of political
convenience, for example to avoid blame for military or political errors that deserve
exposure.&quot;[p. 3]</p>

<p>In order to maintain military security and prevent a massive influx of reporters into
the war zone, reporters were confined to pools during the Gulf War. Representative
journalists were included in the press pool, and their reports were made available to the
rest of the media. Many journalists were dissatisfied with this system, since it greatly
restricted most reporters' access to events, and since the military limited what even the
pool reporters could cover. Retired General Sidle, who continues to work as a consultant
to the Defense Department, argues that in dealing with the press, security and troop
safety must be the military's first concern. Rather than pools, Sidle favors field press
censorship, which he argues provides the maximum freedom for the press, while still
maintaining troop safety. Sidle cautions however that if the media won't limit the number
of reporters it send into a battle zone, the military will have to intervene and impose
limits.</p>

<p>Escalation</p>

<p>The media can contribute to conflict escalation, either directly or indirectly.
Experienced war reporters observe that sometimes the very presence of cameras will prompt
the sides to start shooting.[p. 52] Terrorists often rely on the media. Terrorist attacks
may be calculated to draw media attention, and so draw attention to their cause. In the
absence of media coverage, many types of terrorism would be useless. </p>

<p>Video media in particular tend to focus on dramatic and violent events. It was observed
that &quot;more than ever in terms of news, war is better than peace, violence is better
than non- violence.&quot;[p. 54] This tendency to focus on violence and conflict, and to
further sensationalize violent events can distort the public's perceptions of the
situation. </p>

<p>Many seminar participants felt that the American press, in particular, failed to
adequately investigate the Gulf War, or to report on the causes of the war. Instead the
media &quot;became the mouthpiece for the government, it gave up its privilege of free
criticism, reinforced the us- versus-them syndrome.&quot;[p. 28] Many participants
expressed grave concern that the public seemed quite willing to accept such a
&quot;tame&quot; press. Milton Viorst of the New Yorker argued that, as a result of this
&quot;Congress didn't obtain, and the American people didn't obtain the information needed
to challenge the president on the subject of a war which I believe could have been
avoided.&quot;[p. 11] </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>De-escalation</p>

<p>The media can also contribute to conflict de-escalation. Many people believe that the
media coverage of the conflict played a key role in turning U.S. public opinion against
the war in Vietnam. Lack of popular support eventually forced the U.S. to withdraw from
that conflict. One seminar participant suggested that the constant live coverage in the
early stages of the Yugoslavian conflict helped to contain that conflict by allowing the
parties to publicly vent their emotions and positions. Another participant observes that
the Gulf War &quot;is the first war in the history of humanity where a representative of
the other belligerent appeared almost nightly in the homes of the world. Can you imagine
interviews with Ho Chi Min in American living- rooms at the height of the Vietnam
war?&quot;[p. 64] The media can offer better communication with and better information
regarding the adversary. By allowing each side to see the other relatively directly, by
bringing the opponent into our living-rooms, the media can help to prevent the
demonization of the other side.</p>

<p>Hostages</p>

<p>Former hostage and journalist Roger Auque argued that the media should cover hostage-
takings. The safety of the hostages depends in part on their being remembered by their own
governments and by the broader community. Auque also observed that &quot;Americans have a
kind of naive belief in not negotiating with terrorists, but they benefit as much as
anyone else.&quot;[p. 26] The media often serves as a needed channel of communication
between the terrorists and the target government. However, another journalist observed
that media sensationalism can escalate a hostage situation. When a U.S. television station
described the Iranian hostage situation as &quot;America held hostage,&quot; their
exaggeration simply puffed up the already inflated self-image of the hostage-takers. </p>

<p>Press as go-between</p>

<p>The media can also serve as a channel of communication between leaders, and between
leaders and their constituencies. Ted Turner of CNN recalled that when Philippine
President Marcos wanted to appeal to key U.S. legislators he would ask CNN to broadcast
his speech. CNN would alert the appropriate legislators and then solicit their comments
after the broadcast. Turner said &quot;when we were doing a follow-up story we would find
them quoting each other based on what they had seen on CNN.&quot;[p. 45] Many analysts
argue that Saddam Hussein's Gulf Crisis speeches and appearances were directed primarily
toward developing a stronger Arab constituency.</p>

<p>Selective Focus</p>

<p>Media response to conflict is shaped, and some say distorted, by a number of factors.
Many journalists observed that in the age of video, if there is no picture, there is no
story. Situations which cannot be captured on film, or to which photographer cannot get
access, tend to be under-reported. Visually dramatic, acute events (such as battles or
bombings) receive more coverage, while longer-term, wide-spread situations (such as famine
or poverty) get less. A number of participants observed that while the Gulf War got
extensive coverage, the deaths of over 140,000 Bangladeshis due to spring flooding went
virtually unreported.</p>

<p>This emphasis on the visual also leads to &quot;escalation by anchor man.&quot; In the
age of satellite video the relevant live backdrop comes to represent journalistic
authenticity and credibility. &quot;If I am standing here live, and there is a minaret
behind me, then I am a journalist and you should believe me.&quot;[p. 17] This leads to
competition among the various media outlets to get their &quot;man on the scene,&quot;
even when the &quot;scene&quot; has no real relevance to the story. Referring to the blue
domes which were a favorite backdrop for televised Gulf War reports, one participant noted
that &quot;everybody thought it was part of a mosque, but you know the blue domes are over
the pool [of the Dhahran Hotel].&quot;[p. 62] Another factor which shaped coverage of
stories is the cultivated preference of both the media and the public for good-guy,
bad-guy stories. The Iran-Iraq War resulted in over a million deaths and was of major
political importance but received relatively little media coverage in the West. Both
parties were out of favor with the American public, and so there was no clear &quot;good-
guy&quot; in that conflict. In contrast the Soviet-backed Afghani civil war received much
more coverage at least until the Soviets withdrew from the conflict. </p>

<p>Search for truth</p>

<p>Finally, the traditional role of the media as reporters of the truth can play an
important role in international conflicts. As noted above, a key function of the media is
to give the public the information necessary to make good decisions. The media can seek to
confirm official accounts, reveal official deceit, and correct errors of omission. When
officials claim that there was an oil spill eighteen times as large as the Exxon Valdez
spill spreading off the coast of Kuwait, one reporter hired a helicopter to look for the
spill. She found no evidence of a spill of that magnitude, and revealed that the official
claims were greatly exaggerated. </p>

<p>Veteran journalist Ann Medina stressed the importance of being a first-hand witness.
Official sources, even when they agree, may simply be wrong. She recounted a time where
Canadian and British embassy officials and the Ugandan government all assured the press
that the government still held a key town against rebel forces. However, when she was
finally able to get there in person she found rebel forces in complete control. </p>
