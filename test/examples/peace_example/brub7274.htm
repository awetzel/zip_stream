<p>Brubaker, Dave. &quot;Northern Ireland: Projects of Hope in the Midst of
Violence.&quot; MCS Conciliation Quarterly. Spring, 1988. Vol. 7, No. 2. Pp. 8-9.</em> </p>

<p>Dave Brubaker talks about &quot;projects of hope&quot; in Northern Ireland. Those
projects are directed at promoting ideas of peaceful conflict management and
reconciliation. The article presents an interview with Barry Hart, who spent several
months in Northern Ireland working on a project teaching mediation. He worked with
schools, a juvenile offenders program, a family mediation service in Dublin, and
neighborhood groups. He noticed that people have trouble in confronting those with whom
they are in conflict, usually avoiding them. He and his Irish colleagues tried to create a
positive view of conflict among the people, even though this was a hard task to do in the
context of the violent conflict between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland.
People of the two communities perceived the other side as being inhuman.</p>

<p>Barry Hart believes that mediation skills can promote change in people's attitudes
toward each other and in the ways they handle conflict, toward mutual recognition and use
of nonviolent methods. Especially, he sees a lot of potential in teaching mediation to
schoolchildren going to mixed (Catholic and Protestant) schools. Mediation can help people
to move beyond their positions to understanding of their interests. Barry Hart thinks that
the underlying interests in the Protestant-Catholic conflict are &quot;related to economic
stability and political balancing&quot; (p. 9). Mediation is not a certain cure, but it
helps people to view conflict as serving positive functions for them and their relations
with others. It provides a &quot;safe place and space&quot; for parties to freely
communicate to each other and seek peaceful solutions (p. 9). </p>
