<p>Armstrong, Tony. &quot;Principles of Icebreaking.&quot; Breaking the Ice: Rapprochement
between East and West Germany, the United States and China and Israel and Egypt. United
States Institute of Peace. 1993. Pp. 133-152</em>.</p>

<p>This book describes three cases of conflict transformation, or what the author calls
&quot;rapprochement&quot; throughout which seemingly intractable conflicts were
transformed into new, more productive relationships. Chapter Five summarizes five
propositions suggested by the three case studies covered in this book.</p>

<h3><strong>International Circumstances</strong></h3>

<p>The rapprochement initiatives were cost driven. Successful initiatives resulted from
mutual assessment of costs: (1) the failure of West German policy to keep
&quot;reunification as a precondition to detente&quot; (p. 135), and simultaneous
increased distancing between East Germany and the Soviet Union; (2) United States
experienced a security threat from China and frustration in Vietnam, while China faced
growing isolation; (3) Egypt needed to reduce the military burden, while Israel wanted
peace with Egypt in the face of growing diplomatic strength of Arab states.</p>

<p>The parties also realized that hopes of transforming or defeating the adversary were
impossible to achieve. Thus they could not count on winning the competition with the
adversary. All of these cases contain an event which stimulated such an understanding: the
Berlin Wall crisis, the Moscow Treaty, the Vietnam war, the invasion of Czechoslovakia,
and violence on the Ussuri River. Thus we can talk about international circumstances which
are beneficial for rapprochement.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategies and Tactics</strong> </h3>

<p>From the analysis of the three cases of rapprochement, Armstrong concluded that the
best tactic for breaking the ice is making small steps (unilateral gestures and bilateral
agreements) that communicate the desire and commitment to improve relationships. For
example, interim agreements concerning the Sinai paved the way for a peace treaty between
Egypt and Israel. Other important factors in developing successful initiatives are
personal contact and planning. For example, Ostpolitik and gestures of the Nixon
administration toward China were planned. However, planning played a small role in
Israeli-Egyptian relations. </p>

<h3><strong>Negotiations</strong></h3>

<p>The cases proved the correctness of the assumption that dividing and separating (or
what Armstrong and Roger Fisher call &quot;fractioning&quot;) the major issues of
contention plays a positive role in reaching agreements. Fisher suggests that issues can
be fractioned by reducing the number of parties involved in the negotiations, limiting the
immediate physical issues being considered, limiting the issues of principle being
considered, and/or limiting consideration of either the substantive or procedural
precedents that might be established with the negotiations. Principle and precedent,
Fisher argues, can be reduced in scope by putting conditions and limitations on formal
recognition of the agreements. (Formal recognition can be worked out later). Likewise,
additional issues can be added later as well, once agreements are reached on more limited
items.</p>

<p>Centralization of authority and avoidance of official foreign policy channels is also
evident in the cases of successful rapprochement. For example, Brandt relied on personal
contacts, and Nixon and Kissinger preferred direct secret channels.&nbsp; Initial tough
positions did not guarantee biased agreements.&nbsp; The content of concessions proved to
be more important in reaching an agreement than their number and sequence. Ambiguity of
language allowed the parties to achieve agreements on difficult issues.</p>

<h3><strong>An &quot;Essence&quot; </strong></h3>

<p>The essential principle of all the propositions is the principle of mutual advantage.
The success of rapprochement largely depends on the parties moving from the policies of
unilateral advantage to accepting the principle of mutual advantage in their bilateral
relations.</p>

<h3><strong>Icebreaking in the Post-Cold War Era</strong> </h3>

<p>In contrast with the Cold War international environment, the post-Cold War
international situation is characterized by &quot;fluidity and uncertainty.&quot; However,
the principles of rapprochement can still be applicable to &quot;some adversarial
relationships that share the conditions of long-term hostility and lack of formal
relations&quot; (p. 144). Some of the examples are discussed below.</p>

<h3><strong>Israel and Syria</strong></h3>

<p>The Soviet Union's disintegration and the Persian Gulf War changed the situation for
Israel and Syria. Prior to these events they did not have many incentives to improve their
relationship. However in 1991, direct negotiations between the two countries began.
According to this study, a peace conference is not enough for rapprochement: &quot;. . .
the accumulation of small steps eventually covers large distances&quot; (p. 145). Thus
there is a need for high-level contacts, mediation, and confidence-building measures.</p>

<h3><strong>The United States and Cuba</strong> </h3>

<p>Cuban alliance with the Soviet Union was the major source of hostility between the US
and Cuba. Cuba suffered more from this hostility, but it could offer only limited
rapprochement. The United States did not show much concern over the improvement of
relationships with Cuba. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba lost its supporter.
A bad economy and examples of collapsed dictatorships all over the world do not promise
sustainability for the Cuban communist regime. Most likely Cuba will follow &quot;the East
European model of unilateral reorientation due to change in regime&quot; (p. 147).</p>

<h3><strong>China and Taiwan</strong> </h3>

<p>China gradually moved from threatening Taiwan militarily to suggesting peaceful
unification with the &quot;motherland.&quot; However, for this to happen Taiwan will have
to give up its sovereignty, which for Taiwan means surrender. Thus, unless China will
soften its politics toward Taiwan, rapprochement probably will not happen. Instead of
pressing China to improve relationships with Taiwan, the collapse of the Soviet Union made
reunification less attractive. Reunification can damage China's internal security. The
status quo might be the best alternative for now. The step-by-step approach, suggested in
this study, can be appropriate in reducing hostility and working on building trust between
the two countries.</p>

<h3><strong>The Future</strong> </h3>

<p>Rivalries produced by the Cold War bipolarity will dwindle, because their source is
gone. However, with the emergence of the new states, new conflicts will surface.
Adversaries will eventually start seeking improvement of their relations and the
principles of icebreaking presented in this study, based on successful rapprochement's of
the past, will be very helpful for them.</p>
