<p>Bush, Robert Baruch. &quot;Expectations for International Mediation.&quot; Interaction:
Conference Report. Summer 1996. V. 8, No. 2. Pp. 5, 18.</em></p>

<p>Baruch Bush criticizes the top-down, directive intervention exercised by international
diplomats in their efforts to pressure parties to sign the Dayton Accords. The parties did
not have an opportunity to make their own decisions; rather, the agreements were drafted
by the mediators and the parties were pressured to accept them. The mediators were acting
according to a stereotype of the Bosnian people not being willing to recognize each other.
One of the mediators even said that Bosnians have been living under totalitarian regimes
for centuries, and thus they expect pressure to be imposed on them. The result was the
separation of three ethnic communities by the peace-keeping forces, basically a division
of Bosnia. </p>

<p>Bush understands that an argument can be made for forcing agreement in order to stop
killing. But the question remains of why peace-making was not supplemented with bottom up
intervention, with the objectives of promoting empowerment and recognition among ordinary
people. Instead, funding for Track II diplomacy was reduced. Bush believes that the model
of intervention implemented during negotiations over the future of Bosnia represents
&quot;a wrong direction in the field&quot; of conflict resolution (p. 18). He argues for
bottom-up intervention, which is based on the assumptions of people being able to make
decisions for themselves and being able to recognize each other. </p>
