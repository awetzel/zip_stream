<h1>Information Technologies Can Help</h1>

<p>&quot;<em>Information Technologies Can Help,&quot; Peace Watch, Vol. III, No. 4 (June
1997) p. 6-7.</em></p>

<p>This newsletter presents an overview of a series of panel discussions held during the
U.S. Institute for Peace's 1997 conference on &quot;Virtual Diplomacy.&quot; Conference
participants discussed the ways in which new information technologies could be used to
improve conflict management and prevention. Many relief workers agree, however, that the
main obstacle to effective conflict prevention is not lack of intelligence, but lack of
political will.</p>

<h3>Using Information Technology to Manage Conflict</h3>

<p>The UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs in Central Africa has developed the
Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN). Local relief workers provide
up-to-the-minute information to IRIN staff. IRIN then analyzes and digests that
information into reports which are distributed daily by fax and e-mail to over a thousand
subscribers. IRIN information is also available through ReliefWeb, an Internet site.
ReliefWeb compiles information on regional conditions from a variety of sources. ReliefWeb
is updated daily, and is accessed each day by over ten thousand people world-wide. </p>

<p>Conference participants proposed further uses of the new information technologies. One
proposal is for development of a Humanitarian Extranet, a global net with access limited
to governments and relief agencies. This net would allow for a &quot;back channel&quot; of
communication. Such a limited access system would provide governments the opportunity to
evaluate humanitarian crises and possible responses before the public media began to apply
pressure. It would also foster more collaborative relationships between aid agencies and
governments. The Internet has already proven itself useful in managing conflicts. Chiapas
rebels in Mexico distributed information over the Internet to counter the censorship and
propaganda put forth by government TV and radio. Burmese exiles and sympathizers have used
the Internet to generate global grass-roots support for the suppressed pro-democracy
movement. As a result, a number of large U.S. companies have acted to oppose the
oppressive military regime which currently controls Burma by withdrawing from the country.
Project Bosnia has used the Internet to help reestablish civil society, by connecting
legal, media and governmental information. The Project seeks to encourage rule of law in
Bosnia by providing official with the resources they need to make informed decisions.</p>
