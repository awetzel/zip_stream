<p>It is not easy to define forgiveness since different people understand it differently.
Estrada-Hollenbeck analyzes [people's] narratives to understand forgiveness as an element
of reconciliation. These narratives are stories of how a person did or did not forgive his
or her offender. The author notices that those people who did not forgive their offenders
talked more about their own feelings of being betrayed and victimized, while those who
were able to forgive talked more about the way the offender felt and the way their
perception about the offender became more positive as a result of forgiving. She concludes
that &quot;forgiveness is not an emotion....It appears to be a conscious notion that one
no longer feels negatively toward another&quot; (p. 3). </p>

<p>In terms of group conflict, the narratives describing the historical and contemporary
relations between groups in conflict can help in determining the groups' perceptions about
each other, assisting conflict resolution scholars and practitioners in conflict analysis
and in choosing a strategy for intervention. The narratives of groups in conflict can help
practitioners to frame the issues in a way that will incorporate each groups' basic human
needs. If the relationship moves toward reconciliation, the narratives will show if there
is a fundamental change in perceptions toward the former enemy. Thus narratives can serve
as a diagnostic and a methodological tool, useful for both a scholar and a practitioner. </p>
