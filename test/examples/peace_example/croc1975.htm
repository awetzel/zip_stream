<p>Chester Crocker, &quot;Lessons on Intervention,&quot; in Managing Conflict in the
Post-Cold War World: The Role of Intervention. Report of the Aspen Institute Conference,
August 2-6, 1995, (Aspen, Colorado: Aspen Institute, 1996) pp.77-88.</em></p>

<p>Traditional, interstate conflicts are on the decline. Internal conflicts such as civil
wars or ethnic conflicts are increasing. Internal conflicts have proven to be difficult to
resolve by intervention. Still, the cost of letting such conflict go unchecked is often
very high, and so effective means of intervention must be developed.</p>

<h3>Deciding to Whether to Intervene</h3>

<p>Opponents of intervention typically raise two points. First, they argue that ethnic
conflicts are often too intense for effective intervention. The combatants should be
allowed to exhaust each other, and so their desire for peace to grow, before intervention
is attempted. Second, intervention in internal conflicts violates the target nation's
sovereignty. Outsiders lack a clear mandate to justify their intervention. They often lack
the skills and knowledge to intervene effectively.</p>

<p>Still, there have been some significant and successful interventions into internal
conflicts. The UN oversight of the decolonization of Namibia, and the Cambodian elections
are two notable examples. Crocker asks, when then should intervention be attempted or
avoided?</p>

<p>He suggests that in general &quot;we probably should avoid military entanglement in
nationalist revolutions and civil wars pitting whole groups and classes against one
another.&quot;[p. 79] Crocker notes two exceptions to this generalization. First, we may
intervene militarily if there are overarching strategic reasons to do so. Second, we may
intervene if the issue is important, and success at a reasonable cost seems likely.</p>

<h3>Preemptive Intervention</h3>

<p>In response to the claim that ethnic conflicts are too intense for effective
intervention, Crocker concedes that &quot;it may be that internal wars based on primordial
sentiments tend toward zero-sum thinking and the progressive elimination of neutral or
common ground.&quot;[p. 79] However, very few conflicts are in fact based purely on such
primordial sentiments. The author argues that ethnic conflicts are shaped by a number of
factors. These factors include the actions of foreign powers, the current balance of power
and potential for change, the leader's goals and opportunities, and access to appropriate
military hardware.</p>

<p>So-called ethnic conflicts are precipitated by a number of other factors also. Collapse
of a nation's basic institutions, holding faulty or premature elections, politicians who
exploit ethnicity to promote their own agendas, the availability of the means and
resources to wage war: such situations can set the spark which erupts into ethnic
conflict. </p>

<p>Crocker argues that the most effective way of dealing with violent internal conflicts
is preemptively--by acting early before the violence becomes severe. Nations undergoing
repression or violent upheaval should be encouraged to pursue negotiated alternatives.
Arranging a face-saving exit for soon to be deposed leaders can also be an effective way
of preventing further violence.</p>

<p>Generally, preemptive intervention should focus on those conditions which shape and
spark ethnic conflicts. Crocker argues that the key to identifying and understanding those
conditions is to understand &quot;the process by which politicized conflicts become
militarized.&quot;[p. 80] Militarized conflicts are more complex and more costly to deal
with. The goal then is to intervene preemptively to prevent political conflicts from
becoming militarized.</p>

<p>Crocker describes three examples of such preemptive intervention. First, nations may
seek to avoid premature and possibly polarizing elections. Second, nations should be more
vigorous in their attempts to disarm and reintegrate former combatants into civil society.
Third, Crocker argues that simple secession is unlikely to put an end to internal
conflicts. If a nation is to break-up, the international community must insist on an
agreed, negotiated separation.</p>

<h3>Forms of Intervention</h3>

<p>If intervention is indicated, a further question arises: what kind of intervention
should be used? Generally nations decide how to intervene based on three factors. The
first consideration is the intervening nation's own capabilities and connection to the
conflict. Second, they consider the status and ripeness of the conflict for resolution.
Third, intervention is influenced by the characters of the parties and their
decision-making systems. Crocker argues that a fourth factor should be given increased
attention; Nations should compare the cost of intervention to the cost of doing nothing. </p>

<p>Intervention may be military or diplomatic. Currently, military intervention is not the
most typical form used, although it is called for on occasion. Diplomatic intervention may
be sustained and strategic or it may be episodic. The United States has pursued long-term
strategic diplomatic intervention in the Middle East. Strategic diplomatic intervention
remains fairly uncommon, however. Episodic, crisis-driven interventions are the most
common form of diplomatic intervention. Such interventions can be effective at containing
violence, but alone do not tend to produce settlements or resolutions.</p>

<p>Interventions by nongovernmental organization are new, and on the increase. The author
estimates that NGO interventions are likely more effective than governments give them
credit for, but somewhat less effective than they themselves claim.</p>

<h3>Successful Interventions</h3>

<p>What exactly constitutes a successful intervention is itself a matter of much debate.
For some conflicts, merely avoiding even greater tragedy may count as a success. In
defining success, Crocker argues that &quot;the important point is that those who decide
to intervene...have an obligation to develop their own definition of success, and to keep
it firmly in mind while laboring to avoid becoming part of the problem and making things
worse.&quot;[p. 83]</p>

<p>Whatever standard of success is adopted, certain general considerations apply. The
intervention operation itself must have an efficient, responsive decision-making system. A
decision-maker must be held accountable for their decisions. The operation must take
measures to insures that its forces are not taken hostage or targeted directly by the
combatants. The intervening group must retain and exercise consistent control over the
nature and timing of the intervention. Interventions tend to fail if the intervening group
loses the initiative. The intervention must be backed up by adequate information about the
situation. Often the particular characters of the key players makes a crucial difference
in the outcome of an intervention. Successful UN interventions tend to exhibit these
features.</p>

<p>In terms of strategy, the international community must be willing to support
intervention into some internal conflicts. However, we should not seek to thrust the UN,
or the United States, into every internal conflict. Engaging in interventions which are
unlikely to have some measure of success is ultimately counter-productive. Interventions
must also plan for success. They must follow through with plans to implement any peace
settlement which may be reached. Successful interventions will understand and exploit the
link between diplomacy and military force. Diplomatic interventions gain their force from
military backing; military force requires diplomacy to articulate its goals and interests.
For this reason military intervention is most effective when employed in the context of an
ongoing political peace process. In fact, linking military intervention to a larger peace
process is often the key to a developing a successful exit strategy.</p>
