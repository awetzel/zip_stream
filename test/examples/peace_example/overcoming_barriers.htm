<p>William Ury--Overcoming Barriers to Principled Negotiation</p>

<p>After publishing the first edition of <i>Getting to Yes</i> in 1981, Fisher and Ury
were deluged with questions and challenges. &quot;What do you do when people won&#146;t
play along?&quot; &quot;What about situations where there is no possible win-win
outcome?&quot; &quot;What happens when people respond with unfair tricks?&quot; In
addition to answering some of these questions in the revised edition, which came out in
1991, Ury also attempted to answer some of these questions in a sequel called <i>Getting
Past No</i>, published in 1990. This book presents five steps of what Ury calls
&quot;breakthrough negotiation&quot;--negotiation designed to break through obstacles and
obtain win-win agreements with people who are initially resistant to such approaches. The
five steps of breakthrough negotiation are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1) Don&#146;t react to provocations. Step away from the scene, calm down, and carefully
        plan your response. Do not respond automatically, because most automatic responses are
        negative and further escalate the situation.</p>
        <p>2) Step around obstacles, don&#146;t walk right into them. Use active listening to
        defuse negative feelings, and use I-messages to express your feelings. Agree whenever you
        can, but stand up for your principles as well.</p>
        <p>3) Ask people &quot;why?&quot; &quot;why not?&quot; or &quot;how is that fair?&quot; to
        try to move them away from positional bargaining toward principled negotiation. </p>
        <p>4) Make it easy for the opponent to agree by making the offer as attractive as possible</p>
        <p>5) Make it hard for them to walk away by proving that the negotiated agreement is
        better than their alternatives. &quot;Bring them to their senses, not their knees,&quot;
        Ury advises.</p>
