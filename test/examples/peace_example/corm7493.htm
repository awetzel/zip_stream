<p>Gerald Cormick and Alana Knaster, &quot;Oil and Fishing Industries Negotiate: Mediation
and Scientific Issues,&quot; Environment vol. 28, no. 10 (December 1986), pp. 6-15, 30.</p>

<p>The discovery of oil reserves off the California coast sparked conflicts between the
oil industry and local commercial fishermen. There was conflict over the increased water
traffic, as seismic exploration boats surveyed areas, and supply vessels tried to use the
fastest routes out to the oil platforms. Intersections with a fishing boat's course often
resulted in damaged fishing nets and gear. The fishermen also felt that the acoustic
signals used by the seismic exploration boats dispersed fish, and damaged eggs and larvae.</p>

<p>Rather than turn to a protracted and expensive court battle, the parties pursued
mediation. The fishermen's factual claim that acoustic testing methods damaged fisheries
posed a challenge to traditional mediation methods. To address the factual and scientific
dispute, the parties established the Seismic Subcommittee. Equity issues were addressed by
traditional negotiations in the Joint Committee..</p>

<p>Disputes over Facts</p>

<p>Initially the oil industry took the position that acoustic testing had no negative
impact of fish resources. The fishermen reported an impact. The oil industry resisted
agreeing to further research, feeling that such an agreement would be a tacit admission
that there might be adverse effects. Both side presented data supporting their
contradictory positions, and little progress was made. </p>

<p>As the Joint Committee began to report agreements on equity issues, the Seismic
Subcommittee felt pressure to make progress also. Through the Subcommittee the parties
agreed on a two-stage process. First, they would decide whether there was currently enough
evidence of acoustic impacts on fish to merit further research. If so, the parties would
then jointly develop a research project to investigate the impacts. The Subcommittee also
decided that, should an impact be found, the issue of acoustic impact mitigation would be
the responsibility of governmental agencies. And so the Subcommittee requested the
involvement of ocean resource protection agencies, and of off-shore oil regulatory
agencies. </p>

<p>In order to address the first task, the Subcommittee created the Fish Dispersal
Committee, which convened a Science Panel. The Science Panel was composed of mutually
acceptable, independent scientists. The Fish Dispersal Committee recruited scientists with
stature in their fields, reflecting a diversity of opinions and approaches. Working with
the scientists, the Committee developed an initial research design and hired a contractor
to perform the research. The Science Panel reviewed the data and found that there was
enough indication of an impact to warrant further research. Since it was the conclusion of
jointly appointed, well- respected scientists, the oil industry accepted the possibility
of an impact, and agreed to further research.</p>

<p>The Fish Dispersal Committee proceeded with its second task: developing a more
comprehensive research project to determine the impact of acoustic testing methods on
fish. Again, the Committee worked with the Science Panel to design a mutually acceptable
research project. The Committee also worked together to prepare a request for proposals,
review the proposals received, and choose a contractor. The Committee continued to meet
and monitor the project's progress. Initial findings indicated a need for further study. </p>

<p>The Fish Dispersal Committee was then reconstituted as the Eggs and Larvae Committee,
and began a substantially similar process of joint research. As with its first
incarnation, the Eggs and Larvae Committee continues to meet and monitor the ongoing
research. This continued oversight is important. When problems arise in carrying out the
research (as they inevitably do), the parties can again negotiate mutually acceptable
modifications to the project, and so maintain their joint commitment to the eventual
findings.</p>

<p>The authors observe that &quot;although some of the research findings failed to meet
the expectations of particular industries or agencies, the participants' mutual commitment
to a process that they had designed helped both the negotiators and their constituents to
accept the results.&quot;[p. 13] The reputation and credibility of the scientists involved
also helped legitimate both the research design and the findings.</p>
