<p>In 1988, under negotiations chaired by the UN Secretary-General, the Soviet Union
agreed to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. However, the issue of Afghanistan's future
political and social order remained open. After the Soviet troop withdrawal, the UN
General Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to extend his good offices role to
include helping Afghanistan to develop its own broad-based government. </p>

<p>The Secretary-General had two goals. The first task was to negotiate an agreement
between outside nations, such as the United States, China and India. The Secretary-General
was seeking agreement from such nations to end military aid to Afghanistan, and to stop
fighting over the country. With Afghanistan's fate returned to its own hands, the
Secretary-General's second task was to assist that nation in resolving its internal
ethnic, political and religious conflicts, and in creating a broad-based government.</p>

<p>The Afghanistan case represents a departure from the traditional good offices role
played by the Secretary-General. Although participation by other nations internationalized
the conflict, the Afghani conflict was essentially internal in nature.</p>
