<p><em>Robert Karl Manoff, &quot;The Media's Role in Preventing and Moderating
Conflict&quot;</em></p>

<p>Manoff describes a number of roles which the media could play in preventing and
moderating conflicts. He also offers examples of media peace initiatives.</p>

<p>Media Roles</p>

<p>The media can publicize the principles of human rights and other moral norms, and can
act to enforce those norms by publicizing violations. They can also focus public censure
on hate groups. They can publicize and support peace-keeping operations.</p>

<p>The media can act as a go-between for parties who lack any other means of
communication. When the parties were unwilling to meet, the South African &quot;Peace
Cafe&quot; program interviewed each side separately, edited the videos into a
presentations of each side's case, and then showed the tape to the other side. This
process eventually led to direct negotiations between the parties. In a more direct
mediation, Walter Cronkite served as a very public mediator between Sadat and Begin, and
helped pave the way for Sadat's historic trip to Jerusalem. The media can draw attention
to brewing conflicts, and so create pressure to address the conflict. They can also give
early warning of potential conflicts.</p>

<p>The media can educate the parties about each other's interests, needs, and core values,
and help to confirm the parties' claims of transparency. They can help to undermine
harmful stereotypes and promote rehumanization of the parties. Education in general is
helpful for conflict resolution. The &quot;Capitol to Capitol&quot; broadcast in 1986
filled some of these roles by bringing together American and Soviet lawmakers in a live
interactive program. Both the lawmakers and the audience were able to see the other side
as simply other human beings. Similarly, the &quot;Ism Project&quot; gives college
students video cameras with which to create video diaries of their experiences with
intergroup conflict. These video diaries are later broadcast.</p>

<p>The media can help educate the parties and public about existing conflict resolution
resources, and about other successful cases of conflict management. The Voice of America
radio broadcasts take this approach. The Akron Beacon Journal took a much more active
approach seeking to reduce racial tensions in that city. The Journal convened meeting,
hired facilitators, brought in community groups, and got over 20,000 citizens to pledge to
work for racial harmony.</p>

<p>The media may itself reframe the issues in ways which make the conflict more tractable.
They may aid the parties in reframing issues, and in formulating possible solutions. The
media may also help maintain or achieve a balance of power between the parties, or work to
strengthen the morally superior position.</p>

<p>The media can reinforce leaders' credibility with their constituents, and engage in
other confidence-building activities. The media can work to deflate rumors and propaganda.
The &quot;Radio Boat&quot; was one such, albeit unsuccessful, attempt. A private European
organization stationed a boat in the Adriatic to counter xenophobic propaganda in
Yugoslavia with more objective reporting. Unfortunately, the boats broadcast range was
sharply limited by mountains. The media can offer an outlet for the parties' emotions, and
otherwise aid in the healing and reconciliation process. The &quot;Ism Project&quot;
described above fills this role also.</p>

<p>The media can respect the need for privacy and confidentiality in the negotiation
process. They can also reinforce settlements by publicizing them as important, shared
historical events.</p>
