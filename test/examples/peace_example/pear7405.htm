<p>W. Barnett Pearce and Stephen W. Littlejohn, &quot;Public Dialogue Consortium,&quot;
selection from Moral Conflict, (Thousand Oaks, California: SAGE Publications, 1997) pp.
197-210.</em></p>

<p>The Public Dialogue Consortium (PDC) is made up communications teachers and
practitioners who seek to institutionalize improved forms of public dialogue. Through
ongoing Kaleidoscope sessions the PDC offers a forum where opponents on intractable issues
can discuss their views. Kaleidoscope sessions employ a number of different formats,
governed by a systems orientation. The systems orientation treats communication as an
interaction between people. Communication is shaped by both its grammar and its context.
Systems theorists will focus more on what people actually do in communication, rather than
on attitudes or beliefs. Improving communication then requires improving the context and
grammar based on a clear understanding of what people are doing in the communication
setting. </p>

<p>Kaleidoscope sessions range from ninety minute to full-day meetings. Sessions are
public. Participants include representatives from the opposing viewpoints, and an
audience. Facilitators include a moderator for the representatives, a floor manager for
the audience and a reflecting team. Kaleidoscope sessions have five goals. It seeks to
produce recognition of the opponents' legitimate interests, respect for their beliefs and
experiences, and increase the understanding of both sides' underlying beliefs and values.
In addition, Kaleidoscope tries to demonstrate how disputants shape the conflict by their
joint actions, and helps them to move forward as opponents abandon negative patterns of
communication, replacing them with more constructive patterns. </p>

<p>The PDC forums employ three methods for breaking negative communication patterns and
facilitating constructive communication. First, systematic questioning uses &quot;What
if..?&quot; questions to deepen participants understanding of their respective moral
perspectives, to broaden their understanding of the consequences of their views, and to
imagine possible futures. Second, questions are asked in a spirit of appreciative inquiry.
Appreciative inquiry focuses on uncovering positive aspects in each party's perspectives,
and on enlarging those perspectives. It focuses not on problems but on possible
improvements. Third, the PDC uses reflection, which is &quot;a type of shared
hypothesizing in which an interviewer reflects possible connections, contexts, and futures
bases on answers to systematic and appreciative questions.&quot;[p.203] Reflections are
meant to offer fresh interpretations to the participants. The facilitator must avoid
presenting their interpretation as authoritative, and must be flexible enough to present a
variety of interpretations as the questioning proceeds. </p>

<p>Pearce and Littlejohn argue that moral conflicts often rest on incommensurate views of
reality and differing basic values. Because the conflicting parties do not share a common
paradigm, normal ways of dealing with disagreements can simply exacerbate moral conflicts.
The authors see the PDC model as one way to transcend basic value differences, and
facilitate fruitful moral discussion. They note that, &quot;at the very best, the
participants no longer will view opponents as crazy, ignorant, uneducated, misguided or
immoral but will see one another as concerned citizens with good reasons for believing
what they do.&quot;[p.206] Participants learn that together they can move away from
damaging and negative interactions, and develop more productive forms of communication. </p>
