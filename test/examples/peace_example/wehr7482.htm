<p>The use of threat (and actual force) can be minimized in conflict if participants
remember that it is only one of three forms of social power, and not always the most
influential one.&nbsp; Kenneth Boulding (1989) speaks of power as having three faces;
threat, exchange, and integration (ranging from love to mere tolerance). Threat has the
most intensifying influence in conflict.&quot;If you do something bad to me, I will do
something as bad or worse to you.&quot; Even nonviolent force is threatening; it is
intended to make you do something involuntarily.&nbsp; Contrastingly, exchange occurs when
conflictants indicate that, &quot;If you do something nice for me, I will
reciprocate.&quot; Then, threat is replaced with trade. A power contest characterized by
threat and force gives way to, say, negotiation. Further still from threat action is
integrative power; &quot;I will treat you nicely simply because you are a fellow
human&quot; or whatever. </p>
