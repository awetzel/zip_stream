<p>Based on their life experiences, people develop different perceptions of things and
events. New information often gets filtered through people's established system of views
and is used selectively by them to support partisan perceptions.</p>

<p>An example of this is provided by an experiment conducted by the authors with white
officials while working in South Africa. Participants were asked to look at a picture
which simultaneously depicted an old woman and a young woman. Prior to this, they were
split into two groups and each group was predisposed to view only one of the images.
Predisposed to see a particular image, those groups were not being able to see the
alternative and tried to convince the other to see the picture their way. When
participants were revealed the trick, they were quite amazed how influential
predisposition to certain way of viewing things can be. One of them admitted that if the
people whom he tried to convince in the correctness of his image were black, he would have
completely dismissed their opinions rather than being just puzzled by the differences in
perceptions. </p>

<p>For dealing with conflicts constructively it is very important to understand others'
perspectives and world views; then it is easier to alter them.</p>
