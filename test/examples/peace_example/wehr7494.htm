<p>A primary characteristic of emerging conflict is escalation. Conflict parties begin to
treat one another with more and more suspicion, distance, hostility, fear. The aggressive
actions each takes toward the other are returned in kind but increased in intensity. Thus,
in each round of exchanges, the parties become more belligerent, more hostile, less
cooperative. We speak of this dynamic as upward spiraling.&nbsp; Escalation, by its very
nature, moves participants toward more and more costly conflict. This poses a dilemma for
powerless groups wishing to change the power ratio more in their favor.&nbsp; They wish to
minimize destructive consequences as they bring conflict into the open. How can conflict
groups confront one another, challenge unjust social structures, and do necessary conflict
in a controlled way that does not lead to ever more costly outcomes?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Runaway Responses</p>

<p>As intergroup conflict escalates, Coleman (1957) notes a number of &quot;runaway
responses,&quot; or dynamics supporting escalation. 1) Mutual reinforcement. Reciprocal
causation occurs, with each party's aggressive action eliciting the next intensifying one
from the opponent.&nbsp; Communication between the reciprocators tends to diminish. The
harm each does the other increases with each new round, as does the motivation to win the
struggle. The conflict becomes more and more competitive. 2) From the specific issue to
the general. For example, in an escalating conflict, parties may begin with narrow,
specific complaints about their opponents but move toward more general ones. It is
claimed, for example, that they were hostile in this or that particular instance but that
they are always rather unfriendly. 3) From disagreement to antagonism. A conflict which
begins with impersonal disagreement over an issue will become antagonism directed at
particular opponents and their personal attributes. An advocate for using creationist
textbooks in a school system, for example, will come to be seen and portrayed as a
narrow-minded bigot by his or her opponents. 4) Information distortion. Awareness about
conditions and persons involved in a controversy will be distorted through rumor, hostile
feeling and the fact that people simply want and need more information than is available
from objective sources. They therefore create their own information, and consequently it
will become less accurate. 5) Emergence of extremist leaders. As the conflict escalates,
more extreme persons become leaders of the conflict groups, forcing out moderates.&nbsp; </p>
