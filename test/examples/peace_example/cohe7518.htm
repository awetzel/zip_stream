<p>Setting Deadlines</p>

<p>Selection from: Raymond Cohen, Negotiating Across Cultures: Communication Obstacles in
International Diplomacy, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1991),
147-149.</p>

<p>Setting deadlines which do not reflect strategic concerns can be detrimental to a
negotiating party's interests. The China-U.S. normalization talks of 1978 illustrate how
poorly chosen deadlines can work to the advantage of the opponent.</p>

<p>Both nations had reasons for wanting to speed negotiations. For the U.S., normalized
relations with China would be of some help in upcoming SALT talks with the Soviet Union,
in negotiations over the Panama Canal, and in the Israeli-Egyptian peace talks. China had
much more pressing interests. Normalized relations with the U.S. would prevent the Soviets
from intervening in China's planned attack on Vietnam. Given these interests, China had
the more pressing need for a quick agreement. However, despite their greater need for
normalization, &quot;China successfully concealed its own sense of urgency while the U.S.
acted as though it faced an immutable deadline.&quot;[p. 148] This gave China a
negotiating advantage. In order to close negotiations quickly the U.S. dropped its demand
that China renounce its claimed right to reclaim Taiwan by force.</p>

<p>As a result of the American's unwise insistence on a early deadline, China was able to
use its normalized relations with the U.S. to defend against Soviet intervention in its
planned attack on Vietnam. China was also able to use the Taiwan issue very effectively in
later negotiations. By using it as a bargaining chip, China was able to gain substantial
concessions on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</p>
