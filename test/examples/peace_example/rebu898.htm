<h1>Rebuilding Communities Devastated by War</h1>

<hr>

<p>&quot;<em>Rebuilding Communities Devastated by War&quot;<u>.</u> Peace Watch. United
States Institute of Peace, Washington, DC. V. 11, No. 6. Pp. 1, 8-9</em>. </p>

<p>This article describes several peace-building projects operating on the community level
in Bosnia. After the Dayton agreement, the main focus of international forces was to
separate the parties, maintain the cease-fire and keep the election process going. After
presidential elections were held, the goal of promoting integration in Bosnia became
essential. The grassroots projects described in this article aims at community building,
which is the major key for the survival of the state. </p>

<p>In Tuzla, a local nongovernmental organization lends money to refugee families who want
to open or restart businesses. Samed Salic, for example, borrowed $350 to reopen a
hairdressing business. The program has already lent 45 loans with 10% interest. The money
comes from the World Bank, which in turn uses funds provided by the Dutch government. One
of the aims of the program is to help people to regain trust and self-sufficiency. A loss
of people's trust in anyone except their immediate family is the result of war. The future
plan of the project organizers is to get enough funds to provide larger and more
commercial loans.</p>

<p>Another project was developed in Gornji Vakuf, the town located on the border dividing
the Croat and Muslim parts of the federation. During the war, the front-line was right in
the middle of the town. The Croat-Muslim federation is a major part of Dayton
establishment. But the fact that people from both sides are not willing to cross the line
between the two sections shows that a lot has to be done on a grassroots level to make
this arrangement work. Fifteen international volunteers work on a project that serves this
purpose. The goal of the project is to bring the two communities together by making them
work for the common goal of rebuilding houses destroyed by war. The condition for getting
help from the international community is that they assist each other. In order to
participate in this program, people would have to cross the border and work together. In
addition, they would have some incentives to preserve each others' houses. </p>

<p>A third project is also directed at making the Dayton agreement work on the level of
common people. Under the agreement, movement within Bosnia was supposed to be free. In
reality, Serbs prevented it from happening: until recently there was no free movement
between the Serb Republic and the Croat-Bosnian Federation. The UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) decided to intervene and created a free bus route uniting the two areas.
This is an example of direct involvement of an international organization in a
peace-building initiative. There were a lot of complications: Serbian local authorities
pressured bus companies to stop participating in the project. Then the Danish Refugee
Council hired its own drivers and buses. This did not stop the problems: the buses were
stoned and stopped by Serbian police. The buses now are escorted by international police
and sometimes by NATO's implementation force. The question is, what is going to happen
after those forces leave the area? </p>

<p>This question leads to a general problem of making peace-building projects sustainable.
Sufficient funds and long-lasting presence are important, but it is necessary to
incorporate those projects into a national program. Only in this way can the danger of
fragmentation of peace-building efforts, which even might harden ethnic separation, be
avoided. </p>
