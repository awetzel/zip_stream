<p>Conflict group building requires a carefully considered strategy for furthering a
group's interests and achieving its objectives with minimal cost. Identifying strategic
options (Burgess &amp; Burgess 1996) is something conflict groups often fail to do as they
form and the conflict emerges. Being clear on strategic options at that point is part of
what is known as constructive confrontation , an incremental process by which conflict
parties initiate the conflict interaction with those methods requiring lesser force, then
proceed to more forceful, higher cost tactics as the conflict progresses.&nbsp; A formal
conflict group might do a power resources inventory as an initial step. A conflict group
needs allies, ideological clarity, leaders, funds, a clearly identified constituency and
an effective way to attract potential constituents as formal members. It will find, as it
assesses those potential resources, that it is stronger in some and weaker in others. It
will design a conflict strategy accordingly. It must then mobilize that resource potential
and build solidarity within the group. Being clear about what power it has and could have
will permit group leaders to better plan its confrontation strategy. Sequence and timing
are extremely important in confrontation. If force is used too early in the process or
when moral suasion would be more effective, group interests and goals may suffer. </p>
