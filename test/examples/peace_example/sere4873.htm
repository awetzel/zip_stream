<p>In the early 1960s the Sandinistas formed to oppose the Somoza government. The
Sandinista rebellion had substantial U.S. support. After years of fighting, the
Sandinistas overthrew the Somoza regime, and seized power in 1979. Many surviving members
of the Nicaraguan national guard fled to Honduras. The Sandinista government then allied
itself with Cuba and the Soviet Union. Within the year, the new government's policies
provoked domestic rebellion.</p>

<p>By 1982 domestic insurgents had allied themselves with the surviving Nicaraguan
national guard who were living in Honduras. The rebels were then known as the Contras, or
the National Resistance. The National Resistance had substantial U.S. support. Nicaragua
was in a state of open civil war.</p>

<p>In 1987, in the face of regional conflict, Central American nations convened for
Esquipulas II, and developed the Arias Peace Plan. The Plan described in broad terms a
process for restoring peace to Central America. In March of 1988 the Sandinista government
and the National Resistance agreed to a cease-fire, the Sapoa Agreement, though sporadic
fighting continued through the early 1990s. The Nicaraguan civil war ended formally in
February of 1989, with the Tesoro Beach (El Salvador) Accord, signed by five regional
presidents. Part of that accord was the Tela Declaration, which called for the UN and the
OAS to supervise demobilization of the National Resistance.</p>

<p>The OAS then established a commission, the CIAV(International Commission for Support
and Verification), to oversee the demobilization and disarmament of the National
Resistance, and to supervise and verify their reintegration into Nicaraguan civil society.
CIAV's mandate came directly from the Central American leaders who had signed the Tesoro
Beach Accord.</p>

<p>Nicaraguan elections were held in February 1990. Much to the surprise of both the UN
and the OAS, the Sandinistas did not win those elections. Violeta Chamorro was elected
president. At this point there was no final peace agreement or cease-fire with the
National Resistance. In response to the Chamorro victory, the Resistance began to move
their troops out of Honduras and back into Nicaragua, in order to improve their bargaining
situation relative to the new Chamorro government. The Resistance movement had by then
reformed under peasant leadership, having rejected the leadership of its exiled
politicians, and having grown to distrust the U.S.</p>

<p>Thus CIAV was deployed under unexpected conditions. The UN and OAS had assumed that the
Sandinistas would win the elections, and that Resistance demobilization would occur
outside of Nicaragua. Instead political power had been won by the Chamorro administration,
military power remained with the Sandinistas, and National Resistance forces had returned
to Nicaragua to be demobilized. In addition, CIAV had significantly underestimated the
number of National Resistance troops and supporters who would require assistance and
reintegration. Talks between the National Resistance and the Chamorro government resulted
in the Toncontin Agreement in April 1990. The National Resistance agreed to end
hostilities and relocate within Nicaragua to security zones where demobilization would
begin. The Chamorro government agreed to cease hostilities, and to provide care, support
and rehabilitation for war wounded, orphans and widows. </p>

<p>Despite the Chamorro government's promises, it fell largely to the CIAV to make good on
the Agreement. In order to facilitate the agreement, the OAS agreed to feed all combatants
who reported to the security areas. In the end, CIAV found itself responsible for over
120,000 people- more than ten times the expected number. CIAV also found itself placed in
the role of a buffer between the Chamorro government and former Sandinista and Resistance
combatants.</p>

<p>Sereseres argues that the success of CIAV under these unexpected conditions is due
primarily to the flexibility, inventiveness and resourcefulness of the CIAV leadership.
Generally the OAS, which was based in Washington, DC, did not interfere with the
decision-making of the on-site CIAV leadership. Unfortunately, the OAS did not provide
much support to CIAV either. CIAV's activities and operations have been developed in
direct response to the local conditions. CIAV sought to integrate their social and
development programs with their verification, demobilization and mediation activities,
thus increasing the stability of those programs, and the populations they served. Social
programs targeted geographical areas, rather than limiting assistance narrowly to mandated
beneficiaries, again stabilizing those areas.</p>
