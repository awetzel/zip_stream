<h1>Tactical Stalemates</h1>

<h2>Dean Pruitt and Jeffrey Rubin</h2>

<em>

<p>Selection from: Dean Pruitt and Jeffrey Rubin, Social Conflict: Escalation, Stalemate
and Settlement, (New York: Random House, 1986), pp. 132-4.</em></p>

<p>The authors discuss the purposeful creation of a stalemate by third-parties in order to
facilitate opponents' participation in problem-solving. US Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger is credited with engineering the stalemate that resulted from the October, or
Yom Kippur, War between Israel and Syria and Egypt. </p>

<p>After winning the Six Day War, Israel appeared to have a distinct advantage over Egypt
and Syria. This power inequality made Israel less likely to negotiate with its Arab
neighbors. When Egypt and Syria retaliated by attacking Israel on Yom Kippur, Kissinger
appears to have used American military support and pressure &quot;in order to create a
stalemate that was characterized by relative equality and interdependence&quot;[p. 133] of
the combatants.</p>

<p>Under US pressure, further backed by the specter of Soviet involvement, the parties
declared a cease-fire which left both sides stalemated. The Israelis had cut off the
Egyptian Third Army, but were themselves surrounded by other Egyptian forces. Israel
retained the Sinai territory, but lacked Arab recognition and legitimacy. The Arab forces
lacked territory, but had growing support and could continue to withhold recognition of
Israel as a legitimate state.</p>

<p>Both sides were now roughly equal in power, and unwilling to continue their conflict.
Kissinger then exploited the situation to argue with both sides that &quot;neither side
could hope to move further through force and that their relative equality of power made
genuine trade-offs possible.&quot;[p. 133] </p>
