<p><em>Jeswald Salacuse, &quot;Making Deals in Strange Places: A Beginner's Guide to
International Business Negotiations,&quot; in Negotiation Theory and Practice, eds. J.
William Breslin and Jeffery Z. Rubin, (Cambridge: The Program on Negotiation at Harvard
Law School, 1991), pp. 251-260.</em></p>

<p>Salacuse describes six distinctive features of international business negotiations. The
author begins by pointing out two mistaken assumptions about doing business in an
international setting. Many economic commentators assume that international business deals
will happen naturally if only the correct governmental policies and structures are in
place. Corporate leaders assume that they can simply extend their successful domestic
strategies to the international setting. </p>

<p>Both of these assumptions are mistaken. Policies alone do not create business deals;
companies do. Business executives will need to be much better educated about international
negotiating in order to make successful deals. International business negotiations are
fundamentally different from domestic negotiations, and require a different set of skills
and knowledge. Salacuse explains that &quot;domestic business dealings probably have about
the same relationship to international business as domestic politics do to international
diplomacy.&quot;[p. 252]</p>

<p>Salacuse identifies six elements which are common to all international business
negotiations, and which as a set distinguish international business negotiations from
domestic negotiations. The first is that in international negotiations the parties must
deals with the laws, policies and political authorities of more than one nation. These
laws and policies may be inconsistent, or even directly opposed. For example, in the early
1980s U.S. companies operating in Europe were caught between the American prohibition on
sales to the Soviets for their Trans-Siberian pipeline, and European nations' demands that
these companies abide by their supply contracts. International business agreements must
include measures to address these differences. Such measures typically include arbitration
clauses, specification of the governing laws, and tax havens.</p>

<p>A second factor unique to international business is the presence of different
currencies. Different currencies give rise to two problems. Since the relative value of
different currencies varies over time, the actual value of the prices or payments set by
contract may vary, and result in unexpected losses or gains. Another problem is that each
government generally seeks to control the flow of domestic and foreign currencies across
their national boundaries. And so business deals will often depend upon the willingness of
governments to make currency available. Unexpected changes in such governmental currency
policies can have dramatic effects on international business deals.</p>

<p>A third element common to international business negotiations is the participation of
governmental authorities. Governments often play a much larger role in foreign business
than Americans are accustomed to. The presence of often extensive government bureaucracies
can make international negotiation processes more rigid that is usual in the American
private sector. Sovereign immunity can introduce legal complications into contracts.
State-controlled businesses may have different goals from private companies. Whereas
private firms are usually primarily concerned with profits, state entities may be willing
to sacrifice some profitability for social or political ends such as greater employment.</p>

<p>Fourth, international ventures are vulnerable to sudden and drastic changes in their
circumstances. Events such as war or revolution, changes in government, or currency
devaluation have an impact on international businesses which is much greater than the
impact that the usual domestic changes have on national businesses. These risks
&quot;require that international business negotiator to have a breadth of knowledge and
social insight that would not ordinarily be necessary in negotiating a U.S. business
arrangement.&quot;[p. 255] International businesses try to protect against these risks by
employing political risk analysts, by foreign investment insurance, and by force majeure
clauses which allow for contract cancellation under certain conditions. </p>

<p>International business negotiators also encounter very different ideologies. In
particular, different countries may have very different ideas about private investment,
profit and individual rights. Effective negotiators will be aware of ideological
differences. They will present their proposals in ways that are ideologically acceptable
to the other party, or that are at least ideologically neural.</p>

<p>Finally, cultural differences are an important factor in international negotiations. In
addition to language differences, different cultures have differing values, perceptions
and philosophies. As a result, certain ideas may have very different connotations in
different cultures. For instance, Americans and Japanese tend to have a different view of
the purpose of negotiations. Americans see the goal of negotiations as to produce a
binding contract which creates specific rights and obligations. Japanese see the goal of
negotiations as to create a relationship between the two parties; the written contract is
simply an expression of that relationship. What the Japanese see as a reasonable
willingness to modify a contract to reflect changes in the parties relationship, Americans
see as a tendency to renege. American insistence on adherence to the original terms of the
contract may be perceived as distrust by the Japanese.</p>

<p>Some cultures prefer to start from agreement on general principles, while other prefer
to address each issue individually. Some cultures prefer to negotiate by &quot;building
up&quot; from an initial minimum proposal; other prefer to &quot;build-down&quot; from a
more comprehensive opening proposal. Cultural differences also show up in the preferred
pacing of negotiations and in decision-making styles. Salacuse cautions, however, that
individual negotiators do not always conform to cultural stereotypes. </p>
