<p>Alexander George, &quot;United States-Japan Relations Leading to Pearl Harbor,&quot;
chap. in Forceful Persuasion: Coercive Diplomacy as an Alternative to War, (Washington,
D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1991), pp. 19-23.</em></p>

<p>In July 1941, the U.S. threatened Japan with an oil embargo unless Japan withdrew from
China. Rather than withdraw from China and abandon its imperialist aspirations, Japan
chose to attack the U.S. while it still had the oil reserves needed to wage war. George
argues that in this case &quot;coercive diplomacy provoked the adversary into a decision
for war.&quot;[p. 12] </p>

<p>George points out that, although the U.S. was also pursuing various deterrence
strategies against Japan, the threat of an oil embargo was a more ambitious strategy of
coercive diplomacy. The threat of embargo was intended not to deter Japan from taking some
considered action, but to compel them to withdraw from a current activity. </p>

<p>George suggests a number of reasons why coercive diplomacy not only failed, but
actually provoked war in this case. First, U.S. officials failed to recognize that Japan
had more at stake in the matter than did the U.S. As the situation progressed, the U.S.
sharpened its demands, which in turn sharpened Japan's resistance. Second, the U.S.
strategy relied almost entirely on threats, and made very little use of incentives. This
left Japan to choose among almost equally unacceptable options. Finally, misperceptions,
miscalculations and ambiguous signals between the U.S. and Japan contributed to the
escalation of the conflict. </p>
