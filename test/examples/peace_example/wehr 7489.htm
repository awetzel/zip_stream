<p>Every conflict begins with a latency period (a period when the potential for conflict
exists, but it has not yet developed). Latent conflict may exist for very long periods
before it becomes visible and the conflict actors are conscious of it and behave
accordingly. (Deutsch 1973) In fact, it may never emerge. An alienating social structure
tends to suppress the emergence of social conflict. Marx (1978) saw capitalism alienating
workers from their labor and from one another, inhibiting open class conflict. That
alienation was masked by a culture shaped by the ruling class for the maintenance of its
position. (Gramsci 1971) When race was added to political, economic and cultural control
in a society, as in the colonized world, obstacles to conflict's emergence were even more
considerable. (Fanon 1968 ) In Collins view (1975), social life is above all a struggle
for power and status regardless of the type of structure. An inevitable power differential
between groups, and between individuals, produces latent conflict in all social relations.
But Collins (1992) also points out that the power of those higher on the power
differential ladder is restricted in a number of important ways. Those restrictions permit
the lower-power actor considerable freedom of action.&nbsp; Transforming latent into
manifest conflict is problematic. The way it emerges as open and active struggle will
determine how costly it will be for the parties and the larger society. Can a conflict be
resolved in its latent stage through structural reform? If not, will the emergence process
be characterized by less or more costly conflict methods? How can the opposing parties do
the conflict most economically and least harmfully?&nbsp; Concepts 2: Conflict Group
Formation The differentiation of jobs and positions in a society and the rank ordering of
people by status will inevitably produce conflict groups which bring latent conflict into
the open. People become aware they have interests in common with others like them in
position and status (Dahrendorf 1959). Those interests will center around common
grievances and goals. Group members recognize other groups whose interests will oppose
theirs. The initial stage of group formation may not involve real group-consciousness. But
at some point, leaders will emerge and group formation will become conscious and
deliberate. Members will make decisions about raising group self-awareness, clarification
of group interests and goals, likely allies and enemies, and so forth. At that point, the
character of the struggle will be decided. Group members may then have their best
opportunity to determine the conflict's costs for them. </p>
