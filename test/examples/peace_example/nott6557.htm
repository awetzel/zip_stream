<p>Notter, James. &quot;Theory, Practice, Success, and Failure: A Journey of Learning in
Cyprus.&quot; ICAR Newsletter. Fall 1994. V. 6, No. 2. Pp. 6-7.</em></p>

<p>Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been in conflict with each other for a long period of
time. Eventually the island was divided; peacekeeping forces have been standing between
the two communities since 1964. For 30 years there have been negotiations occurring on
official (UN) as well as unofficial levels (with help from John Burton and Leonard Doob),
but not much has been accomplished. Recent negotiations between the leaders of the two
communities did not bring any change. These attempts at conflict resolution were widely
perceived as &quot;failures.&quot; The author argues against the use of this term. </p>

<p>He participated for several years in training provided by Institute for Multi-Track
Diplomacy (IMTD) and its executive director, Dr. Louise Diamond. The 1992 training was
based on the human needs theory that was adopted to fit the intergroup conflict. Such
group level needs as identity, security, and vitality (&quot;the group's need for growth,
change, and development&quot;(p. 6)) were discussed. In 1993 James Notter participated in
another Cyprus training program designed by Dr. Diamond and based on the idea of conflict
transformation which included &quot;elements of needs-based conflict analysis,
reconciliation and forgiveness, and a personal transformation and renewal, all centered
around a vision of the ideal, a vision of peace&quot; (p. 6). Those who participated in
this workshop were able to transform their views about the conflict and the other party
and maintain their new perceptions, in spite of often negative societal pressures. This
group, which included both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, started organizing intergroup
activities on its own. For the next training program, which took place in 1994, IMTD
cooperated with CMG, Conflict Management Group, an affiliate organization of the Harvard
Negotiation Project. Differences in methodological approaches among the trainers did not
create competition or disagreements, but the possibility of learning from different models
of third party intervention. </p>

<p>As a result of this experience, James Notter began to give more preference to the term
&quot;conflict transformation&quot;. He also looked differently at the term
&quot;intervention&quot;, which implies one time interference in the conflict and is not
applicable in the case of multiple, long-term efforts of <em>conflict transformation</em>
in Cyprus. James Notter believes that we should not talk about the success or failure of a
single intervention, but about whether those multiple efforts were effective in conflict
transformation toward reconciliation and human needs satisfaction. He leaves this
judgement to the Cypriots. </p>
