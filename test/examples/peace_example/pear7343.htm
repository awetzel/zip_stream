<p>W. Barnett Pearce and Stephen W. Littlejohn, Moral Conflict, (Thousand Oaks,
California: Sage, 1997)</em>.</p>

<p>Pearce and Littlejohn seek to develop new, more productive ways of expressing moral
difference and managing moral conflicts. By moral conflicts the authors mean
&quot;situations in which the social worlds or moral orders of the participants are
incommensurate.&quot;[p. x] Their primary approach is via communication theory, but the
authors draw on fields ranging from moral philosophy to the sociology of knowledge. The
text consists of nine chapters in three parts, with an authors' Preface, and suggestions
for further reading. </p>

<p>Part One opens by describing the research which has led Pearce and Littlejohn to focus
on moral conflicts. In the first chapter, the authors describe their investigations of the
&quot;Culture Wars&quot; between the religious right and the secular left in the U.S. They
also describe their work in the Massachusetts Mediation Project, and in the Kaleidoscope
Program. One key observation from that research is that normal ways of handling conflicts
are inappropriate to moral conflicts, and even tend to aggravate and polarize the
discussion.</p>

<p>In chapter two, the authors locate their view of moral conflicts within the broader
literature on conflict. They observe that our understanding of conflict is still changing,
and becoming increasingly sophisticated. The authors favor a process-oriented approach
which focuses on the structure of conflicts themselves, rather than earlier strategic
outcome-oriented approaches which focused on winning a dispute. They focus on conflict
management rather than resolution. In this view, conflict can be beneficial. Pearce and
Littlejohn argue that, &quot;when conflicts are handled well, the participants form
stronger, more open social bonds.&quot;[p. 44] Their goal in this text then is to find
better ways of engaging in and managing moral conflicts.</p>

<p>Chapter three begins this task by examining the structure of moral conflicts. Moral
conflicts arise from moral differences. By moral differences, the authors mean not simply
differences of opinion. Instead they are interested in those differences which stem from
incommensurate moral worldviews or differing social realities. </p>

<p>Not every moral difference results in a moral conflict. The authors give four features
which help to identify moral conflicts. Moral conflicts are intractable and interminable,
and are morally and rhetorically attenuated. Pearce and Littlejohn view moral conflicts as
a form of communication. Communication is a process of making or doing something, and a
process of coordination. Communication is always contextual. By drawing on these basic
principles of communication, the authors hope to provide ways to transform moral
conflicts.</p>

<p>Part Two develops new communication patterns which may improve the quality of moral
conflict. In chapter four the authors argue that in general the quality of public
discourse is poor, (though quantity is great). This is particularly true of public moral
discourse. In moral conflicts, not only is there no agreement on an answer to debates,
there is not even agreement on what counts as good evidence, or a good argument. Pearce
and Littlejohn examine why the quality of discourse is currently so poor, and focus on
improving the quality of discourse at the second level. Specifically, they hope to develop
ways to proceed with productive discourse even in the absence of &quot;an agreed upon set
of conventions about what counts as a relevant contribution, what counts as answering a
question, what counts as having a good argument for that answer or a good criticism of
it.&quot;[p. 104]</p>

<p>The authors observe that &quot;all human beings use language to establish a sense of
self and other, to define the boundary [between us and them], and to create some sort of
orientation toward others.&quot;[p. 108] Chapter five introduces five ways of approaching
differences between people. When differences are not perceived as threatening, people may
communicate in ways that celebrate similarity and ways that celebrate difference. When
differences are more troubling people may react by using persuasion to resolve the
difference. Persuasion requires shared standards of discourse. As noted above, moral
conflicts lack such shared standards, and so persuasion usually fails to resolve moral
differences. Troubling differences may then prompt a move to repress the difference.
Repression can become violent, and is generally not a beneficial way of handling conflict.
The final way of approaching difference is by transcendent discourse. Transcendent
discourse aim to create a new shared language through which the parties can coordinate
their differing world views.</p>

<p>Chapters six explains the notion of transcendence more fully. The authors explore the
tension between expressing and suppressing moral conflicts. They describe three levels
where that tension occurs: between silence and engagement, between clash and peacemaking,
and between encapsulation and transformation. The first choice faced by parties to a moral
conflict is whether remain silent or to speak out and acknowledge the conflict. If the
parties engage in the conflict, they are then faced with the choice of whether to take an
inflexible position, or whether to attempt peacemaking dialogue. Peacemaking may proceed
by attempting to encapsulate the differences, to separate them such that they can coexist.
Or peacemaking may proceed by attempting to transcend the differences, to reframe the
difference in a way that eliminates the tension. For example, &quot;happy and sad are no
longer contradictory when combined into the category of feeling (as opposed to, say,
apathy).&quot;[p. 142]</p>

<p>In part three Pearce and Littlejohn develop the idea of transcendent discourse further.
Chapter seven discusses forms of eloquence appropriate to transcendent discourse. &quot;To
be eloquent is to represent the highest form of expression within a frame of rules adopted
by a moral community. Within a moral community, eloquent speech elicits attention,
respect, and compliance. Between moral communities, however, it can create frustration,
hatred, anger, and even violence.&quot;[p. 157] Transcendent discourse will require a form
of eloquence which bridges the communities. Pearce and Littlejohn argue that transcendent
eloquence must be philosophical, comparative, dialogic, critical, and transformative. It
must uncover the communities' basic assumptions, develop categories to compare
incommensurate differences, seek to explore rather than convince, assess the strengths and
weaknesses of both worldviews, and seek to reframe the conflict into more productive
terms. Chapter eight examines three projects which have modeled aspects of transcendent
discourse. The authors discuss the National Issues Forums, Public Conversations Project,
and the Public Dialogue Consortium.</p>

<p>Chapter nine concludes the text by reviewing the elements of transcendent discourse.
The authors give a broad description of what a transcendent conversation would &quot;look
like,&quot; pointing out the transcendent elements in the previous case studies. </p>
