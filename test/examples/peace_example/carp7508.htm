<p>Susan L. Carpenter and W.J.D. Kennedy, &quot;Reaching and Carrying Out
Agreements,&quot; chapt. in Managing Public Disputes, (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass
Publishers, 1988), pp. 137-154.</p>

<p>Carpenter and Kennedy divide the dispute resolution programs into four steps: adopting
procedures, educating the parties, developing options, and reaching agreements. Before
disputants can discuss a solution to their problem they must first agree on the procedures
that they will use. They must then educate themselves regarding each side's respective
concerns, interests, perspectives, assumptions, and information. Equipped with a better
understanding of the issues and interests, the parties may then move on to propose a broad
range of possible solutions. In the very last step of the dispute resolution process, the
parties evaluate their options and reach an agreement. In this chapter the authors discuss
this final step in the dispute resolution process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reaching Agreements</p>

<p>There are three general approaches to reaching agreements. Parties may first agree on a
general framework for a solution and then proceed to fill in the details. Generally the
parties reach an agreement on basic principles, and then apply those principles to the
particular issues at hand to produce more concrete, detailed agreements. A second approach
is for parties to negotiate each issue separately and independently. Many issues can be
negotiated simultaneously by using multiple negotiation teams. This is often called the
building block approach. This approach can also help to build confidence in the parties.
Parties can start by resolving the easier issues, and then move on to address more
difficult issues with this history of successful resolutions behind them. Finally, the
parties may draw on comprehensive agreement proposals to develop a final comprehensive
settlement. Parties usually bring together elements from different proposals to produce a
mutually acceptable comprehensive settlement. The authors observe that these approaches
are not mutually exclusive. They can be and often are used in combination.</p>

<p>Although there are different approaches to reaching agreements, each approach follows
the same basic steps. The first step is to develop objective criteria for evaluating the
options. For example, the parties could agree that to be acceptable a proposal must be
cost-effective. Once the criteria have been agreed to, the parties must then apply the
criteria to the existing proposals. Unworkable options are dropped. Options that satisfy
the criteria can be further evaluated by comparing their advantages and disadvantages. The
authors note that it is important to get the explicit agreement of all the parties before
any option is either dropped or adopted.</p>

<p>The next step is to reach a consensus agreement on a solution. The parties may trade
off or combine options in order to reach a mutually satisfactory solution. Inability to
agree on an issue needs not block all agreement. The parties may instead agree to drop
that issue, to form a committee to study it further, or to adopt some procedure to address
it further. The meeting's chairperson should periodically test the degree of consensus
reached and should confirm the agreement by restating it. When all the parties agree, the
next step is to write down that agreement. Sometimes, when the parties are distrustful or
when there are simply too many parties to make face-to-face negotiation feasible, a third
party may be used to draft an agreement. In this case the draft agreement is simply a
proposal. Parties comment on the draft, and the intermediary incorporates those comments
into the draft agreement, until consensus is reached.</p>

<p>After the negotiators have reached consensus on a draft agreement, that agreement must
be reviewed and approved by their respective constituencies. Keeping the constituencies
informed throughout the process is key to securing their approval of the final agreement.
When constituencies reject an agreement it is sent back to the negotiators for further
work. The last step is to finalize the draft agreement. The parties incorporate comments
from their constituencies, agree on the exact wording of the agreement, and finally
formally sign the agreement. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carrying Out Agreements</p>

<p>An agreement is only effective if it is carried out. The authors suggest that the best
way to ensure that an agreement will be carried out is to include provisions for
implementation in the agreement itself. Implementation procedures should be established
ahead of time in order to deal with the inevitable misunderstandings and disagreements
which will arise as the agreement is put into effect. Depending upon the nature of the
conflict and the parties' relationship, these implementation procedures may be formal and
detailed, or may be relatively informal and personal. In some cases the parties will be
able to cooperate and determine whether each side is meeting the agreement. In other cases
formal verification procedures, or even third-party oversight, will be needed.</p>

<p>All implementation procedures, whether formal or personal, share four basic elements.
First, there must be some system for monitoring whether the agreement is in fact carried
out. The monitoring body may be either a third party or a committee made up of the parties
themselves. Second, the specific details of implementation must be worked out. The authors
note that &quot;ideally, an agreement will specify precise steps, identify responsible
individuals, and define a reasonable time frame for the completion of activities.&quot;[p.
152] However, agreements are seldom this precise. And even when they are precise,
situations change and unforeseen difficulties arise. The third element then is some
provision for renegotiating sections of the agreement in response to new information or
changed situations. Fourth, there must be procedures for enforcing the agreement and
dealing with violations. The monitoring system is responsible for identifying violations.
Often the most effective way to deal with a violation of the agreement is to find out why
the party violated the agreement. If the party has legitimate reasons, it may be possible
to accommodate their concerns and find an alternate way of satisfying the agreement. If
the party is simply being recalcitrant, it may be necessary to invoke sanctions such as
fines, loss of privileges, or public pressure. </p>
