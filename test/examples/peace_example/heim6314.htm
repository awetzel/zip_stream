<p>Ruth Heimburg, &quot;Pandemonium in Waco: All the King's Horses and All the King's
Men,&quot; ICAR Newsletter 6:1 (Spring 1994) p. 1, 7-9.</em></p>

<p>Heimburg discusses the Waco tragedy and argues that it shows that using force to coerce
submission is not an effective way of handling conflict. She suggests eight specific ways
in which use of mediation and insights gained from conflict resolution studies might have
averted the escalation of violence into tragedy at Waco.</p>

<p>In 1993 armed Federal agents attempted to enter the Branch Davidian commune in Waco,
Texas in order to serve criminal warrants for weapons violations. Violence ensued, killing
four agents and wounding sixteen. Federal agents held the compound under siege for more
than fifty days. The siege ended when Federal forces stormed the compound with tanks and
tear gas. Fire erupted in the compound killing all the remaining Branch Davidians. The
final death toll exceeded ninety people. Heimburg argues that there was no serious
negotiation between federal agents and the Branch Davidians, and no serious consideration
of any option other than force by federal agents. Federal negotiators offered only an
ultimatum: surrender or be forced. Moreover, subsequent analysis of Waco tends to accept
uncritically the propriety of resorting to force. Heimburg argues that the use and threat
of force, in the absence of any real negotiation or mediation process, contributed to the
escalation of violence and tragic conclusion at Waco. Use of negotiation could have
averted that violence.</p>

<p>First, Heimburg notes, &quot;there was a lack of opportunity to exchange reasons for
their respective responses to the underlying conflict conditions and the dynamics of
conflict escalation.&quot;[p. 7] The exact nature of the problem at Waco was never clearly
defined. Federal agents cited concerns with child abuse, weapons violations, and sanitary
conditions. There appears to have been some concern with avenging the deaths of the
initial agents, and with enhancing the agency's images. The federal agents' position that
they could only accept unconditional surrender did not seem relevant to any of their
suggested purposes. Mediation could have been helpful in clarifying the issues and
options, and in separating the issues from positions.</p>

<p>Similarly, a third-party could have helped to identify the participants in the conflict
to each other. There appears to have been some confusion among the Branch Davidians as to
whom they were dealing with. As federal forces stormed the compound Branch Davidian leader
David Koresh contacted the local police offering to surrender. However the local police
were not in contact with the federal agents.</p>

<p>A skilled third-party might have identified the parties' conflict behaviors, including
the tendencies which led to violent escalation, as part of a larger conflict dynamic.
Instead both sides developed a siege mentality. The parties became more fixed and
polarized in their positions, and each saw the other as intransigent and unreasonable.
Similarly, a trained mediator could have identified what each side perceived as the
others' hypocrisy and bad faith as products of the larger conflicts dynamic, rather than
as basic character traits of the parties. </p>

<p>A third-party might also have been able to arrange a mediated meeting between the
parties. Such face-to-face contact tends to humanize the participants, facilitate mutual
recognition, and work against polarization. A third-party would have also insisted on and
facilitated private communication between the parties. Public negotiations tend to
encourage posturing for the audience, and result in intransigence and polarization. </p>

<p>The public nature of the communication at Waco was also damaging, in that the publicity
was largely one-sided. Federal agents were able to create dehumanized image of the
Davidians as fanatic child abusers. Such images encourage escalation by justifying harsh
action by the &quot;good guys&quot; and provoking defensive reactions from those portrayed
as the &quot;bad guys.&quot; </p>

<p>Finally, Heimburg observes that part of the offered justification for entering the
compound by force was that federal negotiators were frustrated and fatigued. Heimburg
argues that federal negotiators' fatigue was due in part to their involvement as
participants in the conflict. They had the double task of both negotiation and defense of
their own positions. Trained mediators could have acted to defuse the parties'
frustration. </p>
