<p><em>J. William Breslin, &quot;Breaking Away from Subtle Biases,&quot; in Negotiation
Theory and Practice, eds. J. William Breslin and Jeffery Z. Rubin, (Cambridge: The Program
on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, 1991), pp. 247-250.</em></p>

<p>Negotiators must be concerned with both the prejudices they may have about others, and
with the prejudices other may have about them. Some types of prejudice are relatively
obvious. A history of hostile relations generally creates fairly clear &quot;us versus
them&quot; prejudices. For example, American-Iranian negotiations will be colored by past
hostilities between those nations. Since these prejudices are fairly overt, they are
easier to identify and deal with.</p>

<p>Breslin points out that there are more subtle forms of bias, such as those based on
people's gender, national origin or occupation. For instance, Asians are expected to be
shrewd and reserved, Americans arrogant and materialistic, Central Americans disorganized
and impractical. Such biases are more difficult to recognize, yet are a fact of life.
These biases can affect how negotiators see others. They can also affect how negotiators
see themselves, and so lead to self-defeating expectations. Negotiators may expect to be
the object of others' prejudices, and so may expect to be ignored or dismissed. </p>

<p>Breslin suggests several ways of combating these subtle biases. The basic tactic is to
focus on the particular individual, rather than on their ethnic or national background.
Remember that there are often greater differ differences within a group than between
groups. Productive interactions between different groups can also counteract stereotypes.
Recognizing that you yourself might hold or be the victim of biases is the first and most
crucial step in combating prejudice. Breslin cautions that subtle biases &quot;are
particularly deadly because they predispose a negotiator to view people as the problem,
not as colleagues who work together to resolve a problem.&quot;[p. 249]</p>
