<p>&quot;Learnings from the Nicaraguan/YATAMA Negotiations.&quot; MCS Conciliation
Quarterly. Spring 1988. V. 7, No. 2. Pp. 6-7.</em> </p>

<p>This article presents an interview with John Paul Lederach about his work in Nicaragua
in mediating the conflict between the Nicaraguan government and the Miskito Indians in
1987-1988.</p>

<p>One of the questions asked was why the Miskito Indians and East coast people in
Nicaragua decided to negotiate with the Sandinista government which had oppressed them at
the beginning of the revolution. According to John Paul Lederach, the Sandinista
government recognized its mistakes and there was mutual awareness between the parties that
war is an awful thing. People were exhausted by eight years of war and suffering. This was
a moment of stalemate when everyone was willing to give up forceful means and work for
peaceful resolution of their disagreements. </p>
