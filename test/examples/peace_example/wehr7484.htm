<p>The movement for civil rights in the US of the 1950s and 1960s illustrates how
moderating a power strategy can greatly reduce the cost of conflict. Until the mid 1960s,
civil rights leaders used a power mix of nonviolent force to end segregation and
discrimination tempered with an integrative view of their opponents as fellow humans
simply doing wrong. They also used some trading behavior in negotiation with businesses
and governments in different cities throughout the South. That was a difficult power mix
to sustain. It had to be forceful enough to open up segregated facilities yet sufficiently
moderate to deter the full fury of racial backlash from southern whites. Nonviolent force
was necessary to escalate the conflict but nonviolent ideological restraint was required
to contain an explosive conflict situation.&nbsp; Leaders of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) such as Martin Luther King were able to maintain a more
moderate mix into the mid-60s, despite Black Panther and SNCC shifts toward increasingly
threatening strategies and a new urgency produced by northern urban riots. But ultimately,
SCLC rhetoric and tactics, too, became more militant in an effort to retain control of the
movement as it moved northward. When King was assassinated in 1968, the movement's radical
wing (and their opponents in urban police departments) ignored the trading and tolerating
power of the earlier movement and went to a much more threatening, force-based approach.
That shift in power strategies was very costly for them and society generally. </p>
