<p>This article discusses &quot;the five structural barriers to successful negotiation of
hazardous waste siting disputes&quot; (p. 3). These barriers are the results of
pre-negotiation decisions. Robert W. Lake, Assistant Professor at the Rutgers Center for
Urban Policy Research, provides the example of a debate over the shape of a negotiation
table, which took place prior to the negotiations that ended the war in Vietnam. The
Vietnamese wanted to negotiate at a round table, while the United States preferred a
rectangular table because sitting at the rectangular table would better reflect the power
imbalance between two parties while round table would give Vietnamese a sense of
recognition and legitimacy. Finally the parties decided on a round table. This story
exemplifies the importance of the structural context of negotiations. </p>

<p>According to Lake, the failure of negotiations over placement of hazardous waste sites
are caused by the structural barriers or prenegotiation decisions that put a community in
an inferior position to a state agency or a developer. The first of those barriers is
&quot;the power of agenda setting&quot;, since the state controls the siting process, it
also takes over the control of the negotiation issues, dictating its own agenda to
community representatives. This produces &quot;sanitized negotiations&quot; with issues
reduced to those which the state feels itself confident to discuss (p. 4). The second
barrier is the &quot;procedural dominance&quot; of the state (p. 5). It issues procedures
and rules for the removal of the hazardous waste and thus it decides on when in this
process to start negotiations and who should participate. The community's prenegotiation
decisions are limited to one -- whether to participate or not in negotiations under the
conditions dictated by the state. </p>

<p>The third structural barrier is &quot;geographical jurisdiction&quot; (p. 5). Since the
agenda is limited to the sitting issue alone, the community is in a position to negotiate
from the local interests (property values and loss of status), while the state is arguing
from the statewide and national interests. In addition, the community is isolated from
other communities, which would rather have a hazardous waste site somewhere else, but not
on their own territory. </p>

<p>The fourth barrier is &quot;moral sanctions&quot;. The community is placed in the
inferior moral position, since the state claims that it defends national and statewide
interests, while the community is &quot;self-serving&quot; in having to protect its own
interests. </p>

<p>The last identified structural barrier is &quot;answerability&quot;. State and local
negotiators have different constituencies to whom they are responsible for the outcome of
negotiations. In the worst scenario, the local officials would accept the siting proposal
on unfavorable conditions. As a result, they might lose popular support and their offices.
State negotiators are responsible to broader and conflicting constituencies. They might
not just lose popular support but also &quot;support from economic institutions and
sources of capital&quot; (p. 6). Thus for state agencies the negotiation is not really
about siting but about gaining or losing political support and status. </p>
