<p>Brubaker, David. &quot;Reconciliation in Rwanda: The Art of the Possible&quot;.
Conflict Resolution Notes. Vol. 12, No. 3. January, 1995. Pp. 25-27.</p>

<p>The conflict in Rwanda started with the killing of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi
when their plane was shot down on April 6, 1994. Hutus blamed Tutsi rebels for this
action. Nearly 500,000 Tutsis were killed in &quot;an orgy of revenge&quot; which started
the Civil War (p. 25). The Civil War was at its peak from April through June, 1994. Almost
2 million Hutus left the country. In four months, the country lost one-third of its
population. On July 4 Tutsi rebels of the &quot;Rwandan Patriotic Front&quot; entered
Kigali and forced the government to flee. </p>

<p>The war did not start on empty ground: tensions between the two tribes originated some
500 years ago. At that time the Batutsis (Tutsi people) came into the region which is now
the territory of Rwanda, which was already occupied by the Bahutu (Hutu people). The Hutu
people worked on the land, while the Tutsis raised cattle. The Tutsis were taller and were
a warlike tribe. Even though they constituted only 10% of the population (Hutus were 90%),
they imposed their rule over the Hutu people. They strengthened their domination by
introducing a mythology of being chosen by God to rule over the Hutus. This ideology
existed during the European colonization that lasted from 1894 until the 1960s. After
gaining independence, Hutus as a majority were able to elect their own president in 1962.
According to Hutus, the history of oppression played a major role in the recent events. It
made them feel threatened by Tutsis, especially when the Tutsi army invaded the country
from Uganda at the beginning of the war. </p>

<p>The author of the article spent three weeks in Tanzania, Rwanda and Kenya, meeting with
refugees from Rwanda to examine the possibilities for reconciliation. He was able to fully
comprehend the horrors of what has happened to those people after listening to the stories
of those who were in the country during the Civil War. One Canadian Red Cross worker told
a story about how he was almost killed by a government soldier when he refused to empty
the truck full of wounded civilians he was driving. Another story was told by a Hutu
pastor who was asked by the members of the Hutu youth militia group to kill a young Tutsi
man. The pastor refused in spite of a threat of being killed. The group then left to look
for another executioner. </p>

<p>After hearing stories like this, the author realized that reconciliation between these
people would not be easy to achieve and it would take a considerable amount of time for
the wounds of war to heal. With such understanding, he and his colleagues decided to start
from the pastors and church members. He and his colleagues conducted two workshops on
healing and reconciliation. The pastors from refugee camps expressed their willingness to
meet with the church leaders in Rwanda. In Rwanda the author met with church leaders and
found out that some of them had already thought of organizing such a meeting. After a few
days of negotiations, a week-long meeting in Tanzania between 25 pastors inside and
outside of Rwanda was scheduled. </p>

<p>The author sees church leaders playing a major role in bringing two parties together
and helping the Hutu become reintegrated into a &quot;now Tutsi-dominated society&quot;
(p. 27). He also perceives reconciliation to be the first step on the way to this goal and
a long-lasting process. </p>
