<p>The United Nations Industrial Development Organization planned UNIDO III, the Third
World Conference, for early 1980. The agenda and proposals for the conference were
developed in secret, and at substantial expense, by the Executive Director of UNIDO. When
revealed, the proposed agenda sparked shock and outrage from the invited nations. First,
the proposals seemed primarily to enlarge and benefit UNIDO. Secondly, the proposals bore
no relation to either the member state real concerns or to what was politically feasible.
Third, the member nations were fundamentally offended at having been excluded from the
substantive planning process.</p>

<p>When the conference began UNIDO's proposals were universally ignored.</p>

<p>In the absence of a proposal, the more radical member states put forth a draft text
which called for a third-world development fund to be created. This fund would be financed
by export taxes on the western, first-world nations and managed by the primarily third
world members of the G-77. The document was accepted over the strident opposition of the
western nations. That opposition threatened to destroy UNIDO, as the western nations
threatened to boycott any further UNIDO meetings. </p>
