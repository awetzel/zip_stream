<p>Joan Broder describes mediation programs that are developing in Northern Ireland and
the Irish Republic. This summary will concentrate on her thoughts about the Northern Irish
conflict and how training in conflict management can change people's perspectives on
conflict. </p>

<p>Unionists, who favor unity of Northern Ireland with Great Britain, and Nationalists,
who want unification with Ireland, for a long time were expecting the British Government
to come up with solutions to their conflict. Recently, it became obvious that the British
Government is unable to resolve it. Thus both communities now realize that they have to
seek internal resources to find a way out of their disagreements. Recently, British
military leaders, and to some extent the Irish Republican Army, accepted the idea that
military force will not bring the conflict to an end. Protestants, who are currently in a
difficult economic situation due to recession, are fearful for their future. Nationalists
have shifted from framing the conflict as being between the IRA and the British government
to accepting the million Protestants living in Northern Ireland as a legitimate party to
the conflict. It also has been known that there were meetings conducted in Germany between
representatives of different Nationalist and Unionist factions. A survey conducted after
the news spread showed that people supported the talks. According to Broder it was the
first time that the people expressed their support for negotiations. The above
developments are a sign of a possible shift in conflict dynamics toward de-escalation. </p>

<p>Broder believes that conflict management training should encourage the Irish people to
change their attitudes toward conflict, from perceiving it as a negative phenomenon which
should be avoided, to understanding its positives sides for the society and individuals.
Having skills in conflict management will give people more confidence in confronting the
conflict constructively, rather than avoiding it. It also will teach them to be patient
and recognize that resolution is a process that should take time to unfold before any
agreement can be reached. Conflict resolution training is an important element of the
process of creating the right environment for negotiation to begin. </p>
