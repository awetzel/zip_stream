<p>Boulding, Elise. &quot;The Challenge of Imaging Peace in Wartime.&quot; Conflict
Resolution Notes. April 1991. V. 8, No. 4. Pp. 34-36.</em></p>

<p>Elise Boulding has been organizing &quot;Imaging a World Without Weapons
Workshops&quot; since 1980 (p. 35). The idea of imaging a better future as a method for
empowering people to work for it was developed by Dutch historian and sociologist Fred
Polak, after World War II. However, the Gulf conflict of 1991 demonstrates that the
countries of the &quot;North&quot; attempt to create a better future for themselves, not
taking into consideration the &quot;South&quot; and its images of a better life. Developed
countries do not want to recognize that people from Arab and African countries might not
hold the imposition of western values and the West's imperialistic tendencies as the image
of their future. Elise Boulding believes that image of the future should become inclusive
of the traditions and perceptions of people from other parts of the world. There is a need
to engage in &quot;cross-cultural imaging&quot; and learn about views and values of the
&quot;South.&quot; Elise and her colleagues are redesigning the workshops to accommodate
the new point of view. The workshops &quot;imaging the world in 2025&quot; will be
conducted in non-European languages and countries (p. 36). What inspires Elise is that
people from different times and cultures have common themes in their images: &quot;a
clean, green world of abundance, joyfully shared by men and women&quot; (p. 36). Staying
realistic but having the image of a better common world will help humanity in achieving a
happier future. </p>
