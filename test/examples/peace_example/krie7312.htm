<p>The Camp David accords created a framework for negotiations over the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. According to the &quot;Framework of Peace in the Middle East,&quot; certain steps
should have been made for the further development of the peace process. It states that the
resolution of the Palestinian issue should include participation of Palestinian, Israeli
and Jordanian representatives in negotiations over the transitional arrangements, and the
withdrawal of Israeli administration after the election of a self-governing authority by
people living in the area. The Israeli government did not follow the Camp David agreement
and Jewish settlements were established in the occupied territories. The major difficulty
was the fact that Jordanian and Palestinian representatives did not participate in
negotiations over the Palestinian issue. Several unsuccessful attempts to do this by
Egyptian, Israeli and United States governments were made. Palestinians and Jordanians,
probably, could have been persuaded to enter negotiations if the Israeli government had
showed any signs of being willing to give up its control over the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Also, if Palestinians and Jordanians had decided to enter negotiations and
recognized the Israeli state, this could have changed the political environment and
influenced the nature of negotiations. These did not happen because of the parties' fears
of each others' response, and of losing public support and surrendering their ideological
commitments. </p>
