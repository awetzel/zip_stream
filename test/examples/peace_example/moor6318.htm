1994. Vol. 6, No. 2. Pp. 4-6.</em></p>

<p>Moorad Mooradian examines the efforts to mediate conflict in Mountainous Karabakh
between the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis. In the course of his research he came to the
conclusion that third parties were more interested in pursuing their self-interests than
in resolving the conflict. Altogether there were four attempts of mediation: by Yeltsin,
the president of Russia, and Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan; by Iranian
government; by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and by Russia. </p>

<h3><strong>Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev</strong></h3>

<p>At the time of the intervention, the Soviet Union was on the edge of complete
disintegration and two presidents were preoccupied with gaining political support in their
regions and on the international arena. The Karabakh conflict was a good opportunity for
them to show their political capabilities and the Soviet federal government's inability to
deal with the conflict constructively. Thus, as soon as their goals were achieved and it
became obvious that the federation would not survive, they withdrew from the mediation. </p>

<h3><strong>The Iranian Intervention</strong></h3>

<p>Iran has 20 million Azeris living in the Northern part of the country. Nationalist
leader Albufaz Elchibey, who was the president of Azerbaijan at that time, was promoting
unification of &quot;Southern Azerbaijan&quot; (northern Iran) with Azerbaijan and
establishing close relations with Turkey. Iran became involved in mediation mainly to try
to stabilize the situation in the region to prevent those claims from becoming a reality.
Also, Iran was interested in improving its relations with the West and mediation could
show its good intentions and improve the prevailing view of Iran as being a center for
disturbance in other nations. Although the adversaries in the conflict denied the
relations between their disagreement and religious differences, Iran's radical religious
elements convinced the Iranian government to support Azerbaijan. Later, Iran withdrew from
negotiations under the pretense of Armenia's aggression (in May 1992 Karabakh Armenians
captured the city of Shushi). </p>

<h3><strong>CSCE Mediation</strong></h3>

<p>The CSCE was unable to establish trustful relationships with the two parties in
conflict. It intervened in the conflict for the first time in 1992. The CSCE was pursuing
a strategy of preserving the borders unless this undermined the right of the nation to
self-determination. Armenians felt that they needed to struggle for this right;
Azerbajanians believed that the Armenians wanted to change the borders of the country by
using military power. The parties also felt that CSCE was attempting to establish a status
for itself as a major peace-keeping force in the region and impose Western values upon
them. Thus neither of the parties trusted the CSCE's willingness and capability to assist
them in reaching an agreement that would satisfy their needs. </p>

<h3><strong>The Russian Intervention.</strong></h3>

<p>For security and economic reasons Russia had a big interest in getting involved in the
conflict. Russia's interests were reflected in its &quot;near abroad&quot; policy which
stated that it had a right to intervene in the conflicts happening in the former Soviet
Union republics to ensure stability in the region. Armenia and Azerbaijan considered the
Russian peace plan more realistic than the one suggested by the CSCE. Russia also was
capable and willing to support its initiative with a peace-keeping operation, which both
sides felt was necessary to separate the warring groups. All the parties, including the
CSCE, recognized that Russia should be a part of the peace process. But they were
concerned with the degree of its involvement, since at times Russia did not maintain
neutrality and assisted one or the other party in conflict.</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion. </strong></h3>

<p>The reason for the Karabakh conflict being stuck at the pre-negotiation stage is due to
serious mediation drawbacks. The mediators were more concerned with their own interests
than that of the parties. Mediators were coming up with peace plans in contrast to
facilitating problem-solving by the parties themselves. Finally, mediation was needed to
resolve conflicts between mediators (Russia and CSCE). Their disagreements can be
reconciled soon since the USA is taking an interest in resolving the conflict. However
this would not reverse the subjective issues of hatred, lack of trust and stereotyping
between the primary parties. Long term negotiation is needed to reach an agreement on
objective (territorial and political) issues. The author suggests that Oslo-type
negotiations or problem-solving workshops can greatly assist political negotiations. </p>
