<p>Symbolic Acts</p>

<p>Selection from: Raymond Cohen, Negotiating Across Cultures: Communication Obstacles in
International Diplomacy, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1991),
pp. 133.</p>

<p>Symbolic acts can play an important role in bringing negotiations to a close. In 1971
the U.S. was trying to persuade a reluctant Japan to revalue its currency in order to
redress a significant balance-of-payments problem. U.S. negotiators demanded a 17-percent
upward revaluation of the yen. The Japanese Finance Minister feigned illness and canceled
his meeting with the American Secretary of the Treasury in order to avoid being forced
into making concessions. </p>

<p>Treasury Secretary Connally met instead with Deputy Minister Kashiwagi. Kashiwagi
stated that seventeen percent was an unacceptable figure. He explained that in 1932 a
Finance Minister had been forced to commit suicide (actually, he had been assassinated)
after agreeing to a seventeen percent revaluation. Connally promptly proposed a
16.9-percent revaluation, which Kashiwagi accepted. &quot;By proposing a substantially
insignificant but symbolically crucial concession, the U.S. Treasury secretary had saved
the honor of his counterpart,&quot; and made it possible for the Japanese to agree.</p>
