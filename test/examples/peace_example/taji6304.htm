<h1>Tajik Opposition Proposes New Constitution</h1>

<hr>
<em>

<p>1995. &quot;Tajik Opposition Proposes New Constitution,&quot; PeaceWatch 1:3, 8-9.
#6304</em></p>

<p>This article discusses the peace talks in Tajikstan, addressing the issue of a new
constitution for the country.&nbsp; It gives a brief overview of the civil war in
Tajikstan. Finally, it discusses peace proposals there.</p>

<p>During <em>glasnost</em> in the early 1990s, Tajikstan's Islamic Movement expressed a
desire to bring back the country's heritage and spirituality by building an Islamic state.
&nbsp; This proposal was opposed by the communists who saw it as reactionary
fundamentalism.&nbsp; They&nbsp; prevented all non-communist parties from voting in the
March 1990 elections.&nbsp; Communist Rahmon Nabiev became president in 1991, and proved
to be an authoritative leader. Opposition leaders protested and the situation escalated to
war in the summer of 1992, when fighting erupted between Nabiev supporters and those who
advocated forming a coalition government composed of democrats and many small religious
groups. Tens of thousands of people were killed, and hundreds of thousands fled into
neighboring countries.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In 1994, another communist, Rakhmanov was elected president by the parliament. &nbsp;
Rakhmanov banned all opposition parties, issuing arrest warrants and death sentences for
all opposition leaders.&nbsp; Islamic Leader Akbar Turajonzoda estimated that as of 1995,
the war resulted in 200,000 dead and 900,000 refugees.&nbsp; &quot; 'Forty-nine of my
close relatives were killed, and they didn't die on the battlefield,' he said, implying
that they were executed on orders of the government.&nbsp; 'Twenty-nine of them were 65
and older, four were 82-84 years old, and my 13 year old son lost an eye in the
bombing.&nbsp; I mention this to give you an idea how difficult it was for us to decide to
begin a political dialogue [with the government].&quot; (p. 8)</p>

<p>Despite these acts, three rounds of peace talks between the opposition leaders and the
Tajik government ensued, though the opposition refused to recognize Rakhmanov's
presidency.&nbsp; As of the date of this article, a fourth round had yet to commence. The
Islamic Movement announced their intention not to seize power, but &quot;to participate in
shaping the future of their nation&quot; (9). They proposed a constitution that included
the right to form religious political parties, in addition to other fundamental human
rights. Their main concern was to end the war and bring peace and democracy to Tajikstan
through negotiation and compromise.&nbsp; &quot;In all civil wars,&quot; argued Islamic
leader Muhammadsharif Himmatzoda, &quot;when guns are all that people know, peace and
prosperity are never reached.&quot; (p. 9.)</p>
