<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>&quot;Security&quot; is one of those relatively uncontested, taken for granted
concepts, which justifies a wide variety of political, military and social activity. At
the national and international levels, political and military leaders invoke
&quot;national security&quot; to legitimate the coercive agencies of the state (the
military, the police, the judiciary, and secret intelligence organisations). Insurance
companies--particularly health insurers--sell &quot;peace of mind&quot; security by
insuring clients against probable and improbable adversity. At the local level, private
&quot;Security Firms&quot; dedicate themselves to the protection of corporate, household
and individual security through the provision of &quot;security systems&quot;; burglar
alarms, electronic surveillance, personal security guards, etc. And there are a wide
variety of other groups whose sole purpose is to regulate and maintain industrial safety
and security.</p>

<p>&quot;Neighbourhood watch&quot; groups endeavour to safeguard specific communities
against a variety of potential threats through informal networks of vigilant citizens. And
in the United States, large numbers of individuals purchase cannisters of mace, hand guns
and other weapons in an effort to counter perceived or actual threats to personal
security. </p>

<p>It is not in the interests of states, insurance companies, security firms or weapon
seeking individuals to ask whether their actions deliver real &quot;security&quot; or to
adopt critical or relativist views of the meaning of security. On the contrary these
groups insist that security is a saleable commodity, or at the very least
&quot;something&quot; attainable, the precise specifications of which will be determined
by public or private &quot;security professionals&quot;. This means that in most debates
about security there is little appreciation of its relative nature and even less awareness
of ways in which security processes inform relationships between all peoples and between
people and nature. </p>

<p>This paper is an attempt to raise some of these questions and map out some of the
dimensions of a sociology of security. In particular, it argues against viewing security
as a contingent, dependent variable (something to be attained in a final and absolute
sense) and in favour of viewing it as a dynamic independent variable. The aim is to
establish security as a basic social process (a changing but integral component of all
relationships), without which social life would be both meaningless and relatively
dangerous. </p>

<p>Thus this paper has both analytic and normative intentions. It asks what factors
contribute to feelings of safety and what socio-political and economic relationships are
most likely to generate maximal security for individuals, nations and the globe as a
whole. </p>

<p>This means contesting the dominant elite views of security as a variable flowing
primarily from the existence of strong state with extensive military capability and
constructing a view of security which may ultimately be guaranteed by state and legal
institutions (although very different ones from those which prevail today) but which has
its origins and receives its most important expression in much more fundamental processes
lying at the heart of society and community. Thus cultural values, processes of sociation,
integration and co-operation are likely to be more important determinants of real security
than strong state systems which rest their power on the military or other forms of
coercive capability. </p>

<p>Viewing security as a contingent variable flowing from a strong nation state (as most
realist/neo-realist thinkers do) inevitably means that the coercive power of the state,
embodied in the power of the police and the military has received an emphasis far out of
proportion to its actual significance in the maintenance of order domestically and peace
internationally. This narrow view of security, resting as it does on offensive/defensive
capability, strategic threat assessments and worst case scenarios stimulates the
development of a thriving weapons culture (for states and individuals) which normally
tends to generate the insecurity it is seeking to prevent.</p>

<p>Protagonists of the realist view argue that it is the judicious use of power and force
which guarantees national values and it is this which is the final sanction for the rule
of law. It is a major contention of this paper that such a view of national security has
delivered more insecurity than security and has frequently resulted in people as opposed
to states becoming alienated from a concept and a process which are of fundamental
importance to their own survival. The persistence of social systems, the maintenance of
social order and the achievement of relatively safe environments can be explained better
by non-coercive, nonviolent processes rather than coercive, violent ones. This is because
non-violent exchanges continue to outweigh the violent in most countries of the world.
They are the norm while violent co-ercive processes are exceptional. To erect national
security regimes on the reverse assumption is to do an injustice to the processes which
really guarantee survival through time.</p>

<p>Thus modern/post modern theorists need not be constrained forever by the pessimistic
and gloomy views of human nature enunciated by Hobbes and the realist school he helped
initiate. On the contrary reconceptualising security in ways which do justice to the means
whereby most individuals attain both a sense of security and actual security may provide
more creative ways of dealing with brutality, inhumanity , threats,fear and anxiety than
those currently offered by the managers of &quot;national security&quot;. </p>

<p>Imbedding the concept of security in fundamental social processes may help contest the
dominant political views of security and enable citizens to determine whether institutions
established to generate security really deliver what they promise. </p>

<p>There are fundamental lessons to be learned from the political revolutions of recent
months. The first is that the limits of possibility hinge more on the quality of our
imagination than the perceived immutability of political and social realities; the second
is that the power and legitimacy of state systems are dependent on the consent of the
governed. Citizens who feel that the state is generating more insecurity than security
have a legitimate right to overthrow those authorities. They are only able to do so
because of an intuitive or learned sense of security that owes little or nothing to the
actions of the state.</p>

<p>WHAT IS SECURITY</p>

<p>Security is a very slippery word to define and even more difficult to operationalise.
Most sociologists ignore the concept altogether preferring to focus on power, authority
,order and control. They concentrate on electoral processes, interest groups, political
organisation and socialisation. There is no recognisable sociology of security.</p>

<p>Political scientists, on the other hand, assume that security is primarily a question
of the survival of the nation state and normally don't bother trying t o define it in any
more detail. They rather lazily assume that security has to do with maintaining the
integrity of the state and protecting national values against actual or imagined
adversaries.[2] What this has meant in practice is that security has become inextricably
associated with the activities of diplomats, security specialists, military personnel,
politicians and those academics who study such people. Security thus becomes whatever
national security elites say it is. There is normally little effort made to see whether
these views coincide with those of other branches of the state or the broader views of
citizens. </p>

<p>Security, therefore, has become one of those taken for granted organising concepts
which political scientists (particularly international relations and strategic analysts)
and their bureaucratic counterparts use without question (Arnold Wolfers and Barry Buzan
being two notable exceptions).[3] In fact most empirical studies in international
relations and strategic studies simply describe processes which maintain the domestic
status quo and perpetuate a now outmoded central rivalry between the two nuclear
superpowers globally. For the last 45 years this central rivalry has resulted in a bias
towards exclusively political and military definitions of security and against more
inclusive socio-cultural definitions.</p>

<p>The Dictionary definition of &quot;Secure&quot; and &quot;Security&quot; is as follows:
Free from danger or risk, or loss; safe. Free from fear or doubt, not anxious or unsure.
Not likely to fail or give way; stable, strong. Anything that gives or assures safety.
Freedom from risk or danger; safety. Freedom from doubt, anxiety or fear; confidence;
something deposited or given as an assurance of the fulfillment of an obligation; a
pledge.[4]</p>

<p>The Latin root of security &quot;securus&quot; literally means &quot;without care&quot;
thus security flows from social processes which reduce risk, enhance normality,
predictability and mutual reassurance. The prospect of complete freedom from care is
impossible and socially undesirable since some uncertainty and paradox is a characteristic
of living and without it human beings stagnate, cease learning and stop exercising
imagination..</p>

<p>The crucial question is how much uncertainty and insecurity is optimal for creative
endeavour and when does insecurity prove dysfunctional for individuals and society? People
who engage in popular sports such as bungee jumping, mountaineering, hang gliding etc.
court insecurity to compensate for the security and stability of everyday life. While
others who live in very dangerous conditions on the margins of existence desire minimal
levels of security to ensure their survival.</p>

<p>It is this ambivalent quality of security which poses so many problems for analysts and
policy makers. Since there is no such thing as absolute security optimal levels of risk
can only be determined experimentally in interaction. We need minimal levels of personal
integration to act socially. Such integration flows from successful socialisation
experiences-e.g. close bonding between parents and children which then provide the basis
for other encounters in schools, churches, work places, public spaces and in our leisure
time activities. While there are elements of threat in early socialisation processes these
are not as effective as those that reward &quot;socially acceptable behaviour&quot;. Those
who endeavour to guarantee security by threat and punishment (national security managers,
police, armed criminals) are in the minority, (despite what the media say). Most people in
most countries of the world exercise restraint and reciprocity in their interpersonal
relationships and thus generate the necessary conditions for relatively stable, secure,
social interaction. If everyone operated on the basis of threat/counterthreat and thinking
the worst of others, social life would be impossible. Which does not mean that there are
no threats or that insecurity is simply a consequence of faulty socialisation. It does
suggest that normal social life, peaceable behaviour, socio-political and economic
security rests on something other than the avoidance of danger and risk. It rests on a
willingness to act in trust and the expectation that most of the time one's trust in
others will be reciprocated. But as Wildavsky notes:</p>

<p>...life is not so straightforward. For the most part, safety and danger coexist in the
same objects and practices. Under the right (or wrong) conditions, everything we need for
life can also maim or kill: water can drown, food can poison, air can choke. Babies cannot
be born without risk to the mother, nor can they grow to adulthood without facing
innumerable dangers. The trick is to discover not how to avoid risk, for this is
impossible, but how to use risk to get more of the good and less of the bad. The search
for safety is a balancing act. For if the axiom of connectedness holds, there is no choice
that results in no harm.[5]</p>

<p>Thus security is a very subjective concept which only assumes real meaning when we ask
additional questions which enable us to see it in terms of particular actors, groups,
organisations, societies, nations and so forth. Security has to become a grounded concept
for it to assume any real meaning. Security for whom, for what and under what
circumstances or conditions? </p>

<p>Families, for example, are popularly understood as archetypal safe places. While this
is probably true for most families in most societies there is a significant minority for
whom these intimate communities are very unsafe and indeed are a cockpit of violence and
aggression. Acknowledging this is not an argument against the institution of the family
but a recognition that intimacy is sometimes abused and an acknowledgment of the fragility
and vulnerability of all social life. Since security is not a thing that is ever finally
attained each social exchange represents an opportunity for highlighting elements that
enhance reassurance and boost confidence or alternatively unpredictable and chaotic
possibilities. Societies only survive through time because most actors choose reassuring
rather than destabilising behaviour.</p>

<p>Women, are much more aware of the fragility of security than men. Because of this their
perceptions of self interest result in interactions with other women and with men aimed at
enhancing trust, confidence, and community. This results in very different conceptions of
security than those of most men and new thinking about national and global security should
incorporate these feminist critiques since they underline the necessity for tilting the
balance in security discussions towards communal rather than individualistic solutions.
Northrup,[6] following Bakan (1966) suggests that men tend to be more agentically oriented
than women and interested in self protection, self assertion and self expansion while
women are more communally oriented and interested in &quot;being at one with other
organisms&quot;. .pa Men thus tend to be more isolated, alienated and alone than women who
favour contact, openness and union. While acknowledging that there are men who think
communally and women who think agentically, Northrup, suggests that:</p>

<p>&quot;...men spend more time and energy thinking, acting and relating in an agentic
fashion, while women focus on communality. It seems likely that these two approaches or
&quot;realities&quot; when either is predominant (unmitigated) will result in different
definitions of security and danger. Carol Gilligan,..in her work on moral development,
suggests that the agentic `reality' defines security in terms of individualism, separation
and achievement, while danger is perceived in intimacy. Within the communal `reality'
security is defined in terms of connection and caring, and danger in terms of
separation.&quot;[7]</p>

<p>Clearly these are polarities that need to be kept together for healthy interaction.
Emphasising one or other end of that polarity poses its own particular problems. Northrup
says that the</p>

<p>&quot;ideal is to have the ability to blend concern for self and other in such a way
that decisions concerning action may emphasise either or both. Taking care of an infant
would seem to require a different combination of agency and communion than defending
oneself against a mugger.&quot;[8]</p>

<p>Irrespective of how the balance between this duality is struck there is considerable
evidence that women try and guarantee their personal security in ways that differ from
most men and also have different perceptions of national and international security as
well. To assume that the views of male &quot;national security managers&quot; have equal
validity for both men and women negates the diverse ways women endeavour to guarantee
their security, distorts gender differences and subsumes women's views to those of men.
Furthermore it is likely to result in women being ignored or treated with indifference in
national security discourse. </p>

<p>Feminist perspectives on security[9] are absolutely crucial to the arguments in this
paper, since both underline the need for relationships which facilitate connectedness and
interdependence. Feminists emphasise the necessity for individuals, groups, organisations
and states to address the quality of their relationships and the tacit and explicit
agreements about the physical, emotional, intellectual and social spaces they occupy. Even
here, however, what constitutes relatively &quot;safe space&quot; for normal social
behaviour raise important gender and class differences.</p>

<p>&quot;Even something as apparently innocuous as the notion of space is incredibly
gendered (and also class and therefore race related etc). People and groups of higher
status and power get to have more space and to have private,&quot;un-violatable&quot;
space, while space is limited and always subject to invasion for lower status, lower power
individuals and groups. Social psychological studies make that extremely clear in relation
to gender. Men (in Western societies at least) are given a significantly larger envelope
of space around their bodies which is never invaded by others, unless by males of higher
status. Women (and to a lesser extent lower status males) have measurably less space
allotted to them in social situations and are touched, pushed and otherwise physically
impinged upon far more than males. For women, .pa space has implications for being abused
physically in all sorts of ways, and also in terms of psychological space women are more
vulnerable to invasions-like sexual harassment, being blamed when they are the victims of
violence and abuse etc&quot;[10]</p>

<p>Northrup's interpersonal concerns apply to the international level as well. Small and
expendable nations (e.g. Grenada, Panama, Lithuania, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Samoa,
Jamaica, Estonia etc), are much more vulnerable than strategically important nations and
know that their interests are best served by policies that advance co-operation and
community. They are thus more likely than larger nations to use the United Nations and
other multilateral bodies to secure their national interests.[11]</p>

<p>Thus while there are some universal elements to security [12] there are also some very
specific security concerns that flow from the structural location of different groups
within societies and between nations. Thus it might be appropriate to think in terms of
&quot;spheres of security&quot; or &quot;security communities&quot; in much the same way
as Michael Walzer does in his book Spheres of Justice.[13] A delineation of these
different spheres and how they relate to each other might heighten inconsistencies between
individual, national or international quests for security and result in higher levels of
consonance and articulation between them. For example, it is often assumed by the managers
of national security that their decisions will have beneficial effects internationally and
automatically enhance individual or group security domestically. The evidence for this is
patchy and it is entirely appropriate for people/ citizens to ask how and in what way
these decisions generate more secure relationships, more interdependence, more real
community at home and abroad?.</p>

<p>It is important, therefore, to be skeptical and suspicious of narrow, exclusive views
of security whose claims are generalised to both genders, all classes, all citizens and
all peoples. Security must be defined sufficiently broadly to encompass the diverse ways
in which individuals and groups endeavour to enhance their own safety and yet narrowly
enough to provide normative criteria with which to judge whether the actions intended to
advance security really do so.</p>

<p>As a working definition, therefore, security can be defined as a fundamental social
process (with some instinctive spontaneous properties) aimed at achieving relatively safe
social, political and economic (spaces) communities. Such communities enable people to
live, move and be true to their own cultures, languages and identities without fear of
direct or indirect violent threat. Integrative relations[14] are both a cause and a
consequence of such safe spaces and they will dominate destructive and threatening
relations. Safe communities are characterised by institutions which facilitate
co-operation, the non-violent resolution of conflict and peaceful social transformation. </p>

<p>Clearly this definition has both analytic and normative aspects. It describes those
milieux within which most people feel safe but it is also an assertion that a secure
community -with strong communal bonds and obligationswill yield more real safety for
individuals than those societies that rely primarily on coercive capability and non
communal contractual obligations. In the latter case state systems may be able to
guarantee law and order domestically and a balance of power abroad but in a paradoxical
way they are likely to be more vulnerable than those &quot;weaker&quot; states which do
not have as much coercive capability. This is because contractual obligations are not as
resilient as communal ones and do not enable individuals to take calculated risks and act
adventurously, safe in the knowledge that they belong to caring communities. It is clear
that modern industrial societies are a combination of both communal and contractual
relationships. In so far as the balance tilts towards one or other end of the continuum
the society will be vulnerable in different ways. Communal societies are predictable but
they might also be stultifying. Contractual societies might be freer but they are also
subject to strong centrifugal pressures. Once again real security is most probable when
there is a healthy combination of both elements. Small societies like New Zealand, Norway,
and Sweden tend towards the communal end of the continuum while large societies like the
United States, the Soviet Union tend towards the contractual. As the dinosaurs discovered,
size generates a very particular kind of national vulnerability.</p>

<p>Realists and neo-realist theorists[15] would argue that the working definition of
security (above) excludes fundamental political realities (power, force, and military
capability) and does not advance any resolution of the &quot;security dilemma&quot;[16]
The counter to this is that more inclusive views of security may make it possible to
develop more stable, normal and less risky conceptions of security for individuals,
nations and the world as a whole.</p>

<p>This is not to substitute a utopian idealist conception of security although the
definition is clearly in an idealist and transformative tradition.[17] There will always
be struggles to attain and maintain reasonable levels of security and it is not possible
to ignore the continuing role and importance of state in stitutions or force and
coerciannationally and internationally. What is being proposed is that the narrow,
exclusive military views of security as depicted by national security managers have tended
to undermine the ability of individuals and social movements to determine for themselves
whether or not particular individual, national (state) or international actions really
advance security. In the final analysis individuals are the only actors able to determine
whether or not government and corporate actions intended to advance security really do so.
In most national security discussions such individual concerns are not considered as
important as those of the security professionals. </p>

<p>Linking security explicitly to community building and the enlargement of safe spaces
provides individuals, social movements, and political leaders with important criteria for
determining whether or not behaviour is likely to enhance or diminish net security. If the
actions of individuals, governments, large corporations, or international organisations do
not result in an expansion of integrative relationships, for example, they will probably
generate short and long term insecurity and a disposition towards threat and
counterthreat. If they do result in an expanded sense of community with sets of negotiated
obligations and responsibilities (locally, nationally, internationally) it is likely that
security will be enhanced. </p>

<p>IDEOLOGY AND SECURITY</p>

<p>In addition to structural location having a profound impact on definitions of security
so too do particular ideological and philosophical assumptions. </p>

<p>The discussion thus far has dodged the question of what difference ideational
/ideological perspectives make to subjective perceptions of security. Clearly security
means different things to those who adopt a realist/neo realist conservative view of the
world and those who adopt an idealist/transformative view of the world. Within these two
divides, however, (and they could be broken down further) there are those who prefer to
conceptualise security narrowly and those who wish to view it more inclusively. (To some
extent this divide parallels that in peace studies between those who are concerned
primarily with negative peace (the absence of war) and those who are concerned with
positive peace (the attainment of peace and justice). There are costs and benefits in
exclusive versus inclusive views of both peace and security. The chief cost and benefit of
a narrow view is that it tends to be state centred and preoccupied with issues of power,
politics, influence and persuasion while generally neglecting psychological, social and
economic variables. The chief cost of an inclusive view is that it introduces so much
complexity it is often difficult to determine what mechanisms are crucial to outcomes. But
if there is a desire to avoid having the &quot;specialists of violence&quot; determine the
parameters of the security debate we need to start with an inclusive view and then work
back to narrower more exclusive views. </p>

common provide minimal order. security narrowly conceived as a means of regulating
international anarchy. The main difference between the idealist and realist perspectives
on security relates to degrees of optimism/pessimism. The idealist prefers to operate from
best rather than worst case assumptions. This is because most human history (despite some
appalling wars and genocide) has been remarkably peaceful. </p>

<p>&quot;Warfare, which figures so prominently in history books, rarely occupies more than
10 per cent of human time and energy. The other 90% or so goes into plowing, sowing,
reaping, weaving, building...and so on.&quot;[18]</p>

<p>Irrespective of whether one adopts an idealist or realist perspective, security remains
relative and highly subjective. There is no absolute security and it is pathological to
try and pursue such a chimera. All of us are more or less secure depending on the context
we find ourselves in and the character of the relationships we negotiate in that context.
Creative living implies significant vulnerability even if responsible living implies
minimising risks wherever possible. There is no way that any individual, group or nation
can make themselves absolutely invulnerable or secure. But by making explicit the normally
implicit and intuitive measures that individuals adopt to protect themselves and by
analysing the ways in which different ideological assumptions operate to determine how we
feel about security, we should be able to analyse the interplay between individual, social
and political action in the negotiation and maintenance of relatively safe
spaces/communities.</p>

<p>TOWARDS A HOLISTIC CONCEPTION OF SECURITY</p>

<p>Barry Buzan[19] and Kenneth Waltz[20] both underline the necessity to adopt a holistic
view of security and wherever possible to keep the three levels of the individual, the
state and the international system together. </p>

<p>&quot;The concept of security binds together individuals, states and the international
system so closely that it demands to be treated in a holistic perspective. Although some
sense can be made of individual security, national security and international security as
ideas in their own right, a full understanding of each can only be gained if it is related
to the other two. Attempts to treat security on any single level invites serious
distortions of perspective.&quot;[21]</p>

<p>The question which neither Buzan nor Waltz posed is what common features bind each of
these levels together. Irrespective of whether one adopts a realist, idealist, inclusive
or exclusive view of security most individuals, states and the evolving global system have
common interests in: preventing harm being done to themselves (damage prevention or
limitation), short and long term survival, independence, the strengthening of community,
the enhancement of economic well being, popularity/good reputation, stability and the
maintenance of specific cultural and belief systems. These minimal shared interests are
pre-requisites for leisure pursuits and more adventurous creativity, imagination and
spiritual searching.</p>

<p>In his analysis of the nation state, Buzan identifies three component parts: its
physical base, the idea of the state and the institutional expression of the state.[22] It
seems useful to extend these dimensions to the individual and global levels as well. Thus
at the individual level we need to know what is likely to preserve and guarantee the
physical base of the individual -food, health, psychosocial integration etc. What
institutional arenas individuals act within (e.g the family, religious,educational,
leisure and work institutions) and what ideational or cultural assumptions individuals
bring to their exchanges with others. How do men and women, majority groups/minority
groups conceptualise security? How do individuals actually act to protect themselves? How
do the institutions of which they are a part reinforce or undermine individual identity
and how do they protect physical health and mental well being. Knowledge of these
processes is particularly important for an inclusive conception of security. </p>

<p>Similarly at the level of the nation state as Buzan proposes, it is important to know
something about its physical base (its short and long term viability) how it is understood
and conceptualised by leaders and citizens and the workings of its key institutions. </p>

<p>Conceptualisation of the world as an indivisible global entity is a crucial element in
the achievement of international common security. But equally important are the diverse
individual and collective conceptions of the global system. What might a global security
system look like and what sorts of institutions need to be developed to give some
institutional expression to this system.? </p>

<p>Conceptualisation of the global system despite the accelerated development of
international non-governmental and governmental institutions is much more difficult than
conceptualising the much more accessible nation state.[23]</p>

<p>What also needs to be added into the mix is some notion of time as well since
perceptions of security at any of these levels will differ on a basis of the time scale
employed. Longer term time scales will generally enable more reflective less impulsive
views of security than those based on responses to immediate and direct threats.</p>

<p>Thus the building of safe places/secure communities is an activity that requires us to
both see and develop connections and relationships between individual, national and global
processes in terms of their spatial, ideational and institutional components. </p>

<p>While narrow strategic understandings of national security acknowledge the importance
of relationships too, (albeit adversarial relations) they tend to ignore the
multidimensional and holistic nature of these relationships by concentrating primarily on
military capability and political intention. Because they are fixated on these phenomena
they often overlook tractable elements in antagonistic relationships. Thus reliance on
coercive power diminishes rather than enhances options since even the most complex and
conflictual relationship always embodies co-operative as well as antagonistic dimensions.
To highlight the remorselessness of adversarial factors is likely to exacerbate rather
than alleviate them. </p>

<p>Highlighting the ambivalent, tractable, nature of relationships, however,and stressing
those that actors feel comfortable consolidating will result in conditions which are more
optimal for the promotion of non-zero sum relationships and real security. To begin
maximising relationships which enhance confidence and trust require the key players to
learn negotiating modes that will advance empathetic understanding in all exchanges.[24]</p>

<p>Because we learn basic lessons about trust and security in close interpersonal
relations the principles underlying these intimate exchanges should be given an importance
equivalent to the preoccupations of grand strategists in security discussions. This is a
very difficult thing for &quot;national security&quot; professionals to accomodate since
they see personal security as an outcome of a hard state rather than a primary cause of a
secure state. Strategists, therefore, are inclined to view social and community security
as soft elements in the national security equations. Yet even strategists acknowledge that
if individuals, communities and minorities are not secure there is no way that co-ercive
power will maintain the survival of the state over the short or long term. </p>

<p>Recent events in Eastern Europe have demonstrated this very graphically. But in the
forgotten parts of the world in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, for example, it is
chimerical to talk of national security in military/political terms when the vast majority
of the peoples in those countries are subject to economic threats, environmental
degradation, human rights abuse, loss of cultural identity and the constant undermining of
basic social processes by poverty, illness and malnutrition. Thus an alternative
reconceptualisation of security must accord as much if not more weight to the enhancement
of individual and communal wellbeing as it does to the maintenance of state institutions. </p>

<p>Another and perhaps more compelling reason for attaching primacy to micro processes is
the necessity for individuals to develop basic protective mechanisms for themselves. Since
these mechanisms may need to be invoked against the state itself it is crucial that their
development not be dependent on it. </p>

<p>Liberal political philosophy has assumed the central importance of the state in
preserving the welfare of citizens. Such notions rest on a contract between governed and
governors in which both parties fulfill their obligations to each other and citizens
expect basic protection and care from the state. When governments break this contract, act
arbitrarily, corruptly, and repressively, legitimacy disappears and popular movements have
a right to agitate for alternatives.The recent popular movements in Eastern Europe have
demonstrated the finiteness of corrupt and tyrannical regimes. </p>

<p>Governmental or state induced insecurity, however, is not just a feature of repressive
regimes. All state institutions exhibit paradoxical tendencies. On the one hand they exist
to guarantee the security of individuals and subcultures but on the other hand and in a
whole variety of ways state institutions threaten citizens as well. </p>

<p>Buzan highlights four types of social threats which originate from states against their
own citizens. These include physical threats (pain, injury, death) economic threats
(seizure or destruction of property, denial of access to work or resources), threats to
rights (imprisonment or denial of basic civil liberties etc) and threats to position or
status (demotion or public humiliation).[25] Whether or not state institutions end up
generating insecurity and social threats among citizens hinges to a large extent on
whether or not they are weak or strong, corrupt or uncorrupt or have a &quot;minimal or
maximal &quot; view of their roles.[26] But it also hinges on whether or not citizens have
been socialised in a way that makes them conscious of when their security is threatened
and when the state is acting arbitrarily and subverting its contract with the people.</p>

<p>The fact is that no state is immune from generating threats to its citizens and these
have to be weighed against the benefits that are conferred in any evaluation of national
security. Internally generated threats against citizens are as much of a challenge to
security as externally generated threats. They are normally not defined as threats,
however, and should be, so that the relationship between state and civil society can be
made explicit and political leaders can be reminded of the real ends of the state security
system. Countries that have abolished the death penalty, for example, are signalling clear
limits and restraints on the power of the state. By waiving their right over life and
death, these states are demonstrating a reverence for life which others that still retain
the death penalty have not. It would be interesting to know whether a willingness to
employ violence against citizens (even as retribution for capital offences) is correlated
with a willingness to use threat and violence internationally.</p>

<p>Similarly states that have renounced instruments of mass destruction for their defence
are signalling clear boundaries over legitimate or acceptable modes of defence and make
themselves safer in the process by signalling that other states should exercise similar
restraint. </p>

<p>In the United States, national security managers place their own citizens at risk in
the act of producing nuclear and chemical weapons. The Rocky Flats plant, for example, has
been afflicted with accidents and sloppy environmental practices which have placed the
citizens of Broomfield, and Denver at risk. How many citizens need to get ill or die
before the costs of such plants outweigh any national security benefits? Asking these
sorts of questions suggests that the specific concerns, and preconceptions of individuals
and communities are only dimly taken into account by those entrusted with determining
national security in a narrow sense. </p>

<p>If it is possible for a state to act in ways which generate insecurity for its citizens
then it is also possible for citizens to do the same for states, through terrorism and
subversion. The claims of each on the other, therefore, have constantly to be evaluated in
terms of whether or not they are likely to result in net welfare for all or net misery.
Thus security,democracy and equality are closely interlinked concepts.</p>

<p>Moving from the individual-state nex of connection and caring, and danger in terms of
separation.&quot;[7]</p>

<p>Clearly these are polarities that need to be kept together for healthy interaction.
Emphasising one or other end of that polarity poses its own particular problems. Northrup
says that the&quot;ideal is to have the ability to blend concern for self and other in
such a way that decisions concerning action may emphasise either or both.&quot;</p>

<p>TAKIS AND SECURITY</p>

<p>The definition and maintenance of boundaries are a crucial component of the quest for
security. Such a process requires some notion of the nature of the boundary (territorial,
linguistic, cultural,sexual) as well as some determination of how permeable or impermeable
such boundaries should be. The argument of this paper is that, wherever possible,
boundaries should be relatively permeable but distinct enough to maintain a coherent sense
of identity. In fact the definition of these boundaries is a part of generating security.
Individual, communal, national boundaries provide something equivalent to the basic
membranes of molecular biology.[27] They help facilitate identity and relatively safe
growing spaces for groups and subcultures. Stable borders and a commitment to
non-interference in the affairs of other countries are an essential component in the
establishment of peaceful relations between nation states. </p>

<p>Boundaries are the means of distinguishing one security community from the other. They
are not necessarily mutually exclusive, however, and social reality is full of overlapping
boundaries, sometimes contradictory and conflictual sometimes consensual. For example, men
and women may perceive security in fundamentally different ways while blurring boundaries
between themselves and accepting the overall confines of the nation state of which they
are a part. Conversely, minority ethnic groups might want to draw tight and distinct
cultural/linguistic boundaries around themselves as a protection against dominant groups
or the state endeavouring to assimilate them. ( e.g. Azerbaijani's in the Soviet Union,
French in Canada). </p>

<p>Delimiting specific territorial or even ideological boundaries has been one of the
principle sources of conflict over the years especially when there are incompatible claims
for the same space.</p>

<p>One of the major problems about thinking globally is the difficulty of establishing a
clear conception of a global boundary. Is it something defined in opposition to nations or
inclusive of nations? Only viewed from space does the world have its physical boundaries
clearly delineated. Its cultural and ideational boundaries are even more complex and
consist of all those diverse cultures that exist within the world as a whole. </p>

<p>As an AFSC study group on this question noted:</p>

<p>&quot;As we considered questions of borders, we were confronted by two realities: the
deep seated tendency of human communities to affirm their own identity by establishing
boundaries between themselves and others and the fact that such boundaries may be
arbitrary and in their implementation often do harm to human beings and
communities&quot;.[28]</p>

<p>So while boundaries are essential means of determining differences between individuals
and states they also have negative features as well. They constitute an impediment to
human solidarity and often divide people who would otherwise have been able to mingle
freely. They are a source of instability insofar as they generate ethnic, linguistic and
cultural conflicts (Recent events in Soviet Armenia, the Baltic Republics, etc. being
notable examples of this as is the constant conflict in the Middle East which is primarily
over safe spaces for Palestinians and Israelis). </p>

<p>Borders can also perpetuate unequal class relationships by allowing access to the
wealthy and denying access to the poor and by border officials being racist and
exclusionary.[29]</p>

<p>For many people their only encounter with the state is with police and customs
officials at national borders. It is there that aliens are made to feel insecure and
citizens receive the benefits and obligations of their citizenship. Insecure states make
access very difficult more secure states are willing to take more risks at borders. Thus
the permeability, malleability, and accessibility of national borders are critical factors
in the evolution of a global security community. Such a security regime will require
national units large enough to facilitate the efficient administration of public goods but
need to be small enough to enable the full expression of linguistic, cultural and ethnic
difference. It will also require the relatively free movement of peoples across borders as
has happened in Europe over the past few years. It will not be advanced, however, by a
rigid adherence to national territoriality and the denial of access to those who wish to
relocate themselves. On the other hand opening up borders to the free flow of labour,
resources and ideas poses its own particular problems in terms of the maintenance of
identity and privilege. So .PA much work remains to be done on specific ways of
transcending narrow national spatial imagery.[30] Such research is critical, however to
the promotion of economic,and sociopolitical processes that will help generate the
development of a global civic culture and security.[31]</p>

<p>If this sounds too utopic it is salutary to reflect on whether anyone 50 years ago
could have imagined that by 1992 there would be a united Europe with a common market and
absolutely permeable borders. The evolution of the EEC, therefore, represent processes
that lie at the heart of alternative definitions of security, e.g. functional integration,
political co-operation, sharing of political power on key economic and social policies,
the development of institutional mechanisms for the non-violent expression of grievance
and the exercise of restraint and reciprocity between states. While there may have been
unique features spurring European integration there are some fundamental ecological,
economic and security imperatives which underly the new doctrines of common security.
These are forcing states to become more open and permeable and are also beginning to
challenge the immutability of national sovereignty itself in much the same way that
cannons (and economic factors) resulted in the end of feudalism.[32]</p>

<p>TRANSITIONAL STEPS IN THE TRANSCENDENCE OF NATIONAL SECURITY </p>

<p>While environmental, developmental and security crises are one way of inducing more
co-operative behaviour there are other reasons as well. Robert Axelrod argues very
persuasively that rigorous self interest dictates non Hobbesian co-operative problem
solving. In his chapter on the &quot;Robustness of Reciprocity&quot; he underlines how
co-operative behaviour can be entrenched between actors and how this will generate self
propelling order and security.[33] Since it is clear that human beings can learn rational
co-operative and peaceable behaviour those who continue to argue for unilateral
adversarial national security policies are restricting their future options and generating
vulnerability for themselves.</p>

<p>Most of the conventional discussions about security[34] divert attention away from the
sociology and politics of security (i.e the embodiment of security in concrete relations
and exchanges between institutions and peoples) onto arcane discussions about military
capability and intention. The major problem with this view is that it assumes that
national and international security is divisible and that pursuit of national interest
will guarantee international security. On the other side those concerned with the
development of global security systems assume the essential indivisibility of security and
see the pursuit of national security as largely incompatible with global security.[35]</p>

<p>As stated ad nauseum in this paper, determinations of security require an oscillation
backwards,forwards and between the individual, national, and international levels of
analysis and an identification of which economic, social and political processes enhance
or detract from real security. This means grappling with paradoxes and acknowledging that
very often &quot;the secret of safety lies in danger&quot;[36] acknowledging that
&quot;being safer than we used to be, the historical standard does not mean necessarily
being as safe as we might be.&quot;[37] Rather the quest for security means taking
calculated risks in the company of others in order to achieve desirable objectives and to
facilitate relatively secure communities at all levels of analysis. At individual levels,
for example, this means processes of radical sociation, forging close, supportive and
communal links with family,friends, neighbours, and workmates and by reclaiming unsafe
spaces through collective action of one sort and another. The women's marches to
&quot;reclaim the night&quot; are obvious examples. But boosting involvement in political
institutions especially in places where alienation is high and participation rates low
will ensure representative institutions become more accountable and responsive to citizen
demands. At a national level-there are both unilateral and reciprocated initiatives that
might begin nudging state systems in alternative directions, e.g. unilateral action such
as that taken by New Zealand in rejecting nuclear deterrent doctrines and endeavouring to
place conditions over the nature of strategic engagement are useful spurs to
reconceptualising dominant strategic doctrines.[38] </p>

<p>Such unilateral initiatives need to be coupled to the development of new security
paradigms to guarantee national defence narrowly conceived. Much of the thinking in this
area by scholars such as Galtung, Johannsen, Boserup and Sharp has stressed the need to
move beyond offensive defence towards defensive or nonoffensive defence and to work out
ways in which invulnerability can be expanded without generating increasing insecurity for
others. In its most radical expression, Sharp and others have argued for a totally
nonviolent civilian based defence either in terms of neutral or non-aligned foreign policy
postures or as novel strategies within alliances. All of these strategies are aimed at
demilitarising national security as much as citizens will allow.[39]</p>

<p>While these suggestions are important in the transition towards a global security
system many of these alternative security proposals (especially those based on defensive
configurations of armed forces) are all based to a greater or lesser extent on the
maintenance of a coercive threat system (albeit a relatively benign one). There is a lot
of evidence to support the view that the maintenance of such a system is itself an
important impediment to a realisation of security in more non-coercive relationships. In
the transition, however, such proposals and those emanating from the Palme Commission
report on Common Security which underline that nations cannot expect to achieve security
at each other's expense have provided crucial new metaphors for helping nations transcend
narrow adversarial views of security and for providing realistic bridges between old and
new conceptions of security.[40]</p>

<p>Regional initiatives aimed at establishing functional integration, and facilitating
confidence, communication and cooperation between nation states are also important. It
looks as though Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland (to name but three) will wish to
affiliate themselves economically and politically to either EFTA and the EEC as well and
it is not beyond the realm of possibility that there will be an integrated security system
in Europe within the next 50 years. </p>

<p>While the EEC is a particularly graphic example of regional integration there are a
number of other regional attempts to develop policies that may eventually lead away from
narrow national attempts to guarantee security. While most have not been as spectacular as
that in Europe they do deserve to be celebrated as transitional steps towards regional and
hopefully global security regimes. Thus, for example, the denuclearisation of Antarctica,
the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone, the Latin American Nuclear Weapon Free Zone,
and discussions about a single security community in Europe, while they have taken place
within an orthodox national security discourse, have tried to enlarge the number of safe
places at a regional level. They have done so by concentrating on trying to remove or
transfer what is perceived as the greatest threat of all--intended or unintended nuclear
war and then by working out ways of preempting military solutions to regional problems,
minimising polarisation and confrontation and by establishing defence policies that do not
generate insecurity for others. In all the regions mentioned there is still a long way to
go before these objectives are even partially realised but current geo-political
conditions are much more propitious than those which prevailed two to three years ago and
there is a much higher awareness (even among traditional strategists) of the necessity to
make rather rapid moves from counter productive strategies. </p>

<p>Processes like the CSCE talks in Stockholm for example, have generated greater
confidence between states and vindicate many of the propositions advanced in this paper.
But such processes need to be expanded and applied to regions outside of Europe if they
are to result in expanded regional steps towards a global security regime.[41] The
significant thing about many of these developments is that they represent state responses
to popular demands and thus straddle individual-state-international levels in a
progressive fashion.</p>

<p>The onus is still on social scientists, however, to demonstrate that the values
embodied in an inclusive view of security, peace, justice, human rights, development,
environmental integrity and a sustainable future can all be achieved without systems of
threat and violent coercian. The terrible dilemmas posed by pathological people internally
and threatening nations internationally demand more than platitudes. Those interested in
socio-political transformation have an obligation to demonstrate how they would deal with
threats of violence and actual violence. We need to know what non-violent, non-coercive
inducements are applicable to the solution of social and political conflicts between
individuals, groups, nations and within the global system as a whole? What mechanisms
exist to both pre-empt and resolve violent conflicts once they have occurred in ways which
enhance real security and peaceable relations. What institutions are available to help
disputants resolve conflicts? What non-governmental and governmental organisations can
substitute for coercive agencies? Above all these questions is the fundamental issue of
whether there be any real security for anyone in a world that is so radically divided into
rich and poor</p>

<p>?There are many questions which can and must be asked but there are also many signs
that the world is on the verge of a paradigmatic switch of fundamental proportions in
relation to both a more inclusive conceptualisation of security but more importantly some
attainment of it. It is not going to result in an end to threat, coercian and violence
overnight but the delegitimation of violence (which is occurring in many parts of the
world) is creating important new opportunties for the promotion of real security.
President Gorbachev's initiatives have been a powerful force assisting this transition and
have largely removed the raison d'etre for current US national security policy. Although
there are a number of question marks over the post-containment period in regard to old
ethnic hostilities and new nationalisms there has also been a quite astonishing
delegitimation of violence as an appropriate means of dealing with dispute and generating
security.</p>

<p>Accompanying these processes, must be a reactivation of global visions to enlarge
horizons for peoples and policy makers. At a UN sponsored symposium on global security for
the Twenty First Century, for example, there was an attempt to combine reduced East-West
rivalry with expanded equality between North and South and a recognition of the diverse
psychological and spiritual dimensions of security.[42] At an earlier United Nations
Colloquium on Teilhard de Chardin in 1985 considerable attention was paid to the necessity
to undergo a transformation of consciousness. &quot;To deal with peace, then, we must
undergo a parallel transformation; from tribal, national consciousness to global
consciousness. We must activate a sense of belonging to the entire human community, of
being citizens of the entire planet; and we must acquire a perspective from which to view
the Earth and the entire human community as a whole... At this point in history, we need
not only a symbol of peace but visionaries of peace--thinkers who can transform that
symbol into an horizon of consciousness, a perspective, a vision, a wisdom that will help
us deal with peace (and security) as a global issue.&quot;[43]</p>

<p>Clearly such statements will not by themselves ensure the development of a new global
security system nor will they result in the cessation of the corrosive conflicts that
continue in many parts of the world. Nor will they result in safer neighbourhoods or
cities or put the nuclear genie back in its bottle. But they are important visions of what
might be, and insofar as these visions begin transforming the discourse on security and
insofar as people start acting to give expression to these new visions they provide the
best chance we have for generating a safer and more secure world.</p>

<p>The task of articulating and implementing a global security system will not be easy but
we have to begin somewhere. Reclaiming common sense understandings of what is likely to
generate safety and by contesting those who use the term security to subvert lasting and
real security is a good beginning. Delineating the intuitive and taken for granted nature
of security as it is embodied in normal human relationships and exchanges should provide
us with a means of determining the extent to which they are applicable to more complex
organisations and systems. It is not possible to reduce macro processes to micro ones but
the micro-processes seem to hold many of the clues as to how we should conceptualise and
begin to realise greater security in the future. </p>

  <li>One of the key evolutionary questions is what precipitated the critical growth, division
    and development of the very first cell. In particular the key question is how molecules
    snapped together to form membranes. I cannot explain the chemistry of this but Harold
    Morowitz in his delightful book, Cosmic Joy and Local Pain: Musings of a Mystic Scientist,
    (1987) New York: Charles Scribners, suggests that amphiphilic hydrocarbons -or molecules
    with an oily end and a water soluble end -will, given the right conditions, snap together
    to form membranes. Once this happens, fragments of this membranous material will
    spontaneously form into closed surfaces and biological individuality occurs. This is
    because: </li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;A membrane is a firmament to separate the waters of the cell's interior from the
waters of the environment. In more scientific terms a membranous vesicle impedes the free
flow of molecules between the interior and the exterior and thus establishes a space (the
cells interior) or thermodynamic system, within which different chemical processes can
occur and reaction products can be retained... I tend not to think about the question of
when life began. Rather the issue is when chemically active organic cycling systems gave
rise to three zones: the inner watery substance, the oily membrane, and the outer watery
substance. From a biophysical point of view, the membrane is the point of interface
between the I and the Thou within the realm of existence. Insofar as there is exchange
across this membrane, the I and the Thou are connected; insofar as this exchange is
restricted the organism and the environment have a certain measure of autonomy.&quot; (pp
233 -234)</p>

<p>Thus Horowitz suggests that fundamental growth and existence depends on two things,
namely the establishment of boundaries and the development of safe spaces within which
complex chemical and physical reactions take place. I don't know whether physical
scientists would like me extrapolating from this insight but it seems to me that many of
our fundamental social science questions also have to do with the establishment of
boundaries (permeable or impermeable). I am grateful to Elise Boulding for bringing this
theory to my attention and for suggesting how and why safe places are critical for human
growth and development.</p>
