<p>Generally, any proposal to create a hazardous waste facility will be greeted with
community opposition. In 1980, in an attempt to overcome this opposition and build the
needed facilities, the Canadian providence of Alberta developed a providence-wide siting
and education process.</p>

<p>The education portion consisted of a series of public forums which gave the public
&quot;a comprehensive picture of waste-handling procedures from doorstep to dump and of
their own civic responsibility in preventing indiscriminate dumping.&quot;[p. 210]</p>

<p>The siting portion relied on multilevel mapping. First, the government made a series of
maps of the province based on current land use, and human, physical and biological
characteristics. These maps were then overlaid to identify constraint-free areas. These
initial maps and the mapping process were then opened up to public comment, via a series
of grassroots public meetings. The public was encouraged to aid in the further development
and refinement of the mapping process. Next, the government called for volunteers from
among the communities in the constraint- free areas. Swan Hills was chosen from among the
five volunteer communities. Government negotiations focused on &quot;tax benefits,
economic spin-offs, roadway improvements, employee housing, and employment priority for
local township residents.&quot;[p. 210] While misunderstandings forced some renegotiations,
an agreement was reached in 1984 and the Swan Hills Plant is operational.</p>
