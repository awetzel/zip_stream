<h1>A Mohawk Confrontation in Canada</h1>

<h2>Rudy Friesen</h2>

<hr>

<p>Friesen, Rudy. &quot;Reflections on Oka: The Mohawk Confrontation.&quot; Conflict
Resolution Notes. April 1991. V. 8, No. 4. Pp. 36-38.</p>

<p>Rudy Friesen looks at several reasons why negotiations between the Canadian/Quebec
government and the Mohawk tribe were unsuccessful. The conflict arose over the issue of
extending &quot;a golf course into land which the Mohawks felt was sacred&quot; (p. 36).
In addition, this extension would have violated the 18th century treaties between the
tribe and the government.</p>

<p>Three causes for the failure of negotiations can be identified: (1) the imbalance of
power between the two parties, and the government's resistance to give more respect to the
Mohawk people. While Indians perceive themselves as a separate Nation, Canadian
authorities do not recognize them as such, claiming that they are Canadians despite the
treaties &quot;signed between Indian nation states and Canadian officials&quot; (p. 36).
(2) The parties did not agree on the agenda of negotiations. The Mohawk people had
concrete issues that they wanted to discuss, such as sovereignty, land, and preservation
of natural resources. The government though did not seem willing to approach the conflict
constructively. It perceived &quot;the warriors as criminals&quot; and tried to break them
into &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; Indians (p. 37). This framing of the conflict
did not allow for constructive conflict management since it was based on the view that
force was the only way of dealing criminals. (3) The parties could not agree on
preconditions to negotiations. Several attempts to start negotiations failed due to the
government's unwillingness to consider Indian proposals. John Paul Lederach, who was
invited by the Indians to mediate the conflict and helped to draw those proposals,
suspected that the government never really wanted to resolve the conflict through
negotiations. After rejecting the Mohawk's proposal to remove barricades under the
condition of continuing negotiations &quot;without arrests being made&quot; (p. 37),
government officials walked out, not even offering any counter suggestion. The order to
remove barricades by force followed. As a result of this confrontation, the golf course
will not be extended, but the issues dividing two sides have never been addressed. This
creates a potential for future conflict. </p>
