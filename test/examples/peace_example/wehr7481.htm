<p>Force is a form of conflict behavior that should be used cautiously if at all. As
competitive action, it moves a conflict away from cooperative resolution. It also tends to
be more costly to both users and their opponents. The more costs that participants sink
into a conflict, the more difficult it is for them to &quot;sacrifice&quot; those costs in
shifting to cooperative resolution.&nbsp; Force is a threatening type of social action.
One makes or promises to make someone do something against their will. Even if force is
not actually used by conflict parties, the possibility that they could or will use it is
present and will influence the conflict. Potential force is usually more useful for
cooperative resolution than applied force. Since less harm is done, less needs to be
undone later. We can think of threat as a moderate type of force.</p>
