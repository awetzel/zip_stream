<h1>Religion and Reconciliation in Bosnia</h1>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Religion and Reconciliation in Bosnia.&quot; Peace Watch. April 1997. V. III, No.
3. P. 10. </p>

<p>Vinco Puljic, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Sarajevo, presented his thoughts on the
situation in Bosnia after the Dayton agreement during a discussion organized by United
States Institute of Peace (USIP). Puljic has always supported multi-ethnic composition of
Bosnia and has been against its division. While the military conditions of the Dayton
Accords have been implemented, political issues remain unresolved. In addition, local mass
media keeps promoting nationalistic stereotypes. This makes ethnic relations very tense
and reduces the effectiveness of reconciliation efforts. </p>

<p>For reconciliation to happen, a dialogue between the communities needs to develop. This
dialogue should be based on trust and confidence, which can be promoted through initiating
the process of parties' recognition of each other and acknowledging their mistakes. In
order to build confidence and trust and encourage a dialogue between ethnic communities
&quot;issues of common interests and agreement&quot; should be identified (p. 10). One of
the efforts in this direction is the attempt to create &quot;a council of religious
leaders&quot; which would encourage a dialogue between Bosnian religious communities.
Vinco Puljic also mentioned two letters of Catholic Bishops of Bosnia and Herzegovina
calling for reconciliation, and the future &quot;visit of Pope John Paul II to
Sarajevo&quot; (p. 10). </p>
