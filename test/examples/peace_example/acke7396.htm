<p>Peter Ackerman and Christopher Kruegler, &quot;Introduction,&quot; in Strategic
Nonviolent Conflict, (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 1994), p. xix-xxiv. </em></p>

<p>Ackerman and Kruegler argue that the use of nonviolent action in conflicts is on the
increase. In their Introduction to the text, the authors list a number of features of the
contemporary international scene which may encourage the increased use of nonviolent
action. They note that NGOs are playing larger roles and wielding increasing power in
international affairs. &quot;Nonstate actors may find that their particular attributes and
capabilities make them especially well suited to waging nonviolent conflict.&quot;[xxi] </p>

<p>Ethnic conflicts are on the rise globally. Given the potential of ethnic conflicts to
escalate dramatically and violently, and so to provoke international censure, ethnic
groups may well turn toward nonviolent conflict to press their demands. Marginalized
groups have not been very successful in using terrorism to achieve their goals. Groups
which had resorted to terrorism may turn to nonviolent strategies, which have had a
somewhat better success rate.</p>

<p>Nonviolent resistance may be used as a form of civilian-based national defense. This
approach prepares the general population to use nonviolent resistance should another power
attempt to invade. The goal is to make it impossible to successfully occupy and govern the
invaded territory. Civilian-based defense may be an appealing option to small states which
have no realistic hope of defending themselves by military force.</p>

<p>It has often been thought that nonviolent action is most effective in democratic
states. The authors suggest instead that nonviolent conflict may be a precursor to
democratization. &quot;Effective nonviolent conflict may be shown to precede, abet, and
defend the democratizing process.&quot;[xxiii] And so supporting nonviolent action is one
way to encourage and support democratization.</p>

<p>Finally, they note that technological advances, especially in communications, have made
strategic nonviolence easier to use and more effective. They have also created new
opportunities for nonviolent action. The authors caution, however, that technology in and
of itself does not give an advantage to nonviolent actors. Technology can also be used to
dominate and oppress. Ultimately, nonviolent actors must always out perform their
adversaries in order to succeed. </p>
