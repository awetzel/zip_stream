<p>Among the first experiments with getting opponents to question their perception of a
conflict reality were Burton's &quot;controlled communication&quot; workshops (1969). He
brought representatives of nations and societies in hostile interaction to a program of
intense examination of their perceptions of &quot;objective&quot; reality and of one
another. He would use a range of exercises, including optical illusion graphics, to get
participants to question their beliefs about what was &quot;real.&quot;&nbsp; Herbert
Kelman has brought together young academicians and diplomats representing opposing sides
in a conflict. His work with Palestinians and Israelis (1982) is especially well known. An
emphasis in his approach has been to sensitize participants to the problem
&quot;realities&quot; faced by, especially the constraints on, their opponents. &nbsp;
Mitchell and Banks (1996) have reviewed these &quot;scholar-practitioner&quot; approaches
whereby social scientists have applied theory in conflict intervention. A central theme in
all of them has been to produce for the participants at least a partially reconstructed
reality. &quot;Hopefully, [they] return cold and sober, as enhanced realists. They know
with greater clarity the nature of the situation that their parties mutually
confront.&quot; ( p. 145)&nbsp; Reality reconstruction workshops have a special problem;
reentry from the workshop setting into the conflict situation participants temporarily
left behind. There will be an inevitable disconnection between the reality reconstructed
in the workshop and the unreconstructed reality to which they return. Even their
participation may be seen as &quot;fraternizing with the enemy,&quot; which may place them
at personal risk, as was apparently the case with some in the Doob (1974) intervention in
the conflict in Northern Ireland. Such intervention by those who are external to the
conflict carries the same risk. They rarely suffer what might be negative consequences of
their intervention. Representatives they use in such programs always have constituencies
to whom they must answer, whose realities may remain quite
&quot;unreconstructed.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
