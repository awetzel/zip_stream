<p>Heidi Burgess, &quot;Environmental Mediation (The Foothills Case)&quot; in Resolving
Environmental Regulatory Disputes, eds. Lawrence Susskind, Lawrence Bellow, and Michael
Wheeler, (Cambridge, MA: Schenkman Books, 1983), pp. 156-221.</p>

<p>The Foothills case is an example of a complex, multiparty environmental dispute. The
Foothills project was a proposed raw water treatment plant intended to meet the Denver
area's future water demands. The Denver Water Board (DWB) was the main proponent of the
Foothills project. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various environmental
groups were the main opposition. Numerous other groups also had stakes in the project. The
issues in the case were complex and broad in scope. The dispute involved issues of growth
and development, urban sprawl, air pollution, environmental impact, water conservation,
urban- suburban competition, eastern- and western-slope conflicts, local versus federal
control, broader water planning policy, and even debates over proper lawn care. The
situations was further complicated by uncertainty over the facts.</p>

<p>Uncertain Facts</p>

<p>The DWB claimed that their current water treatment facilities would be inadequate to
meet projected Denver area water needs beginning in 1977. DWB projections assumed
increasing population growth, and increasing per capita water usage. The DWB concluded
that the Foothills project was the necessary solution to this projected shortage. The DWB
also argued that not building the Foothills facility would encourage undesirable urban
sprawl. Without the new facility Denver would have to continue its limitations on new
water taps in the Denver suburbs, which would encourage developers to move out into areas
beyond Denver's jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The EPA and environmentalists questioned the DWB assumption of increasing water usage.
They argued that current facilities wold remain adequate if a program of water
conservation and rationing were put in place. In direct opposition to the DWB claims, they
claimed that not building the Foothills facility would discourage urban sprawl.
Maintaining the limitations on new taps in the suburbs would encourage developers to build
within the city of Denver. They further argued that there were existing public trends
toward a conservation ethic, and a back-to-the-city movement, and that these trends would
increase. The DWB countered by claiming that the English Garden-style yard was a central
and &quot;historic&quot; value of the Denver people, and that &quot;neither narrowly based
special interest groups nor federal officials have the right to reject the people's choice
and destroy this Historic Value!&quot;[p. 162]</p>

<p>The Foothills controversy was politically charged. In the early stages of the conflict,
both sides publicly attacked the other's credibility. Foothills supporters and the
pro-Foothills newspaper the Denver Post attacked the EPA, questioning their expertise in
the water supply field and calling EPA analyses &quot;naive&quot; They charged the head of
the EPA with politically motivated and inappropriate meddling. One environmental activist
produced and publicized a report which charged the DWB with &quot;misleading the public,
inaccurately assessing the need for additional water treatment, and withholding figures
that the public must consider if they were to make an informed decision.&quot;[p. 170]
Activists went to the Denver District Attorney asking that the DWB be charged with
criminal violation of the Colorado Open Records laws. The D.A. concluded that there was no
evidence of a violation, and no charges were made. </p>

<p>Data Mediation</p>

<p>By 1977 the Foothills controversy focused on the 404 permit review. Since the Foothills
project involved building a new dam, the DWB had to obtain a 404 dredge-and-fill permit.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reviews such applications. However the EPA has final veto
power over 404 permits. An EPA veto of the 404 permit would send the Foothills case
through the Federal hierarchy to end up in Federal court. Litigation would be costly, both
politically and economically, to both sides. Neither side was sure it could win in court. </p>

<p>Faced with this stalemate, Congressman Wirth (a Denver area representative) proposed
mediation. Wirth persuaded the Corps of Engineers to undertake a comprehensive study of
the remaining issues, positioning the Corps as a neutral third-party. He then persuaded
the DWB and the EPA to agree, if only tacitly, to be bound by the Corps review. The DWB
felt that the Corps would be sympathetic to the Foothills project. The EPA was concerned
about possible Corps bias, but conceded Corps expertise in dam design. The Corps had
statutory authority to conduct such a review, and neither side felt that they had a better
alternative than to accept the Corps data mediation. However, both parties publicly
maintained their right to reject the Corps' findings.</p>

<p>Wirth solidified the parties' commitment to mediation by publicizing the process.
&quot;Wirth told the press that he was hopeful' that the Corps' study would be binding. As
the study went on, the Denver Post continued to reinforce this notion, thereby increasing
public pressure, which, in turn, prevented the parties from withdrawing.&quot;[p. 179]
Wirth also involved the DWB and the EPA in designing the Corps study. Working together,
the DWB, EPA and the Corps identified three key issues: projected water needs, project
impacts, and project alternatives. The parties also agreed that the review was to be
thorough and in-depth, and would be limited to unresolved issues. At each stage of the
review the Corp released its initial findings publicly, accepted comments and objections,
and then responded by revising their analysis or offering further justification. In the
end, the EPA still opposed the Corps' assessment of the environmental impact of the
proposed dam, and the viability of alternatives.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>While the completed Corps review did not itself produce a settlement, it did provide a
basis for further negotiation. The process also increased public pressure on the parties
to reach a settlement. As importantly, the negotiations surrounding the Corps review had
broken down some of the hostility and distrust between the parties, thus paving the way
for further, more fruitful negotiations. A negotiated settlement of the Foothills case was
finally achieved in 1979.</p>
