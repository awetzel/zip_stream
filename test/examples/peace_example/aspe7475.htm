<p><em>Aspen Institute, &quot;Conflict Prevention: Strategies to Sustain Peace in the
Post-Cold War World,&quot; (Aspen, Colorado: The Aspen Institute, 1996), pp. 23-31.</em></p>

<p>Participants at the 1996 Aspen Institute Conferences on International Peace and
Security discussed strategies to sustain peace in the post-Cold War era.</p>

<p>Secession and Self-Determination</p>

<p>Czechoslovakia was made up of different ethnic groups. Slovakia in particular wished to
secede. With the end of the Cold War Czechoslovakia was eager to avoid the sort of bloody
collapse that Yugoslavia suffered. The Czechs used democratic processes to address their
ethnic conflicts and avoid warfare. The central government negotiated with the breakaway
Slovakian republic, but negotiations failed to produce an agreement. When negotiations
failed the central government held a democratic referendum on the issue of Slovakian
secession. The secessionists won the referendum and the resulting separation into the
Czech Republic and Slovakia became known as the &quot;velvet divorce.&quot; </p>

<p>Regional Intervention</p>

<p>Burma was taken over by a military coup. The ruling military junta renamed the country
Myanmar,' and have been responsible for ruthless political repression and serious human
rights abuses. The International community has moved to isolate Myanmar, in the hope that
denying moral and political legitimacy to the regime will pressure it to undertake more
democratic reforms. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) prefers a policy of
constructive engagement. ASEAN hopes that political integration into the region will give
the regime time to change, and that opening Myanmar's economy will lead to greater
political liberty. By engaging with Myanmar ASEAN also hopes to prevent that regime form
forging close ties with India and China.</p>

<p>Justice and the Rule of Law</p>

<p>South Africa succeeded in making a generally peaceful transition from a system of
racial apartheid to democratic majority-rule. This success was due in large part to
intense internal efforts to pursue justice through legal methods. The National Peace
Accord provided for local level peace committees which were charged with ending violence.
The peace commissions had extensive subpoena and search-and-seizure powers. To ensure that
the inquiries were unbiased, senior police officers from the European Union were included
on the commissions, and the UN was invited to observe. Foreign legal experts were also
called in for special investigations. The de Klerk administration respected the authority
of the peace commissions and did not intervene politically in investigations. The new
parliament established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and appointed Nobel Peace
laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu to head the Commission. The Truth Commission was charged
with investigating human rights violations and making reparations. The all-white, all-male
apartheid era judiciary was also replaced.</p>
