<p>In 1966 the UN General Assembly decided that South Africa's control over West South
Africa was illegal. This decision was upheld by the International Court of Justice. In
1989 political conditions finally allowed the UN to begin the process of transferring
power from South Africa to the new nation of Namibia. The United Nations Transition
Assistance Group (UNTAG) oversaw the successful transition. </p>

<p>UNTAG had three main tasks. First, it would supervise preparations for free elections
in Namibia. Second, it would supervise the deliberation and adoption of a new Namibian
constitution. And third, UNTAG would assist in the formation of the new Namibian
government. Fulfilling these tasks required the assistance of a number of other UN groups
and organizations. UNTAG also benefited greatly from the close attention and guidance of
the Secretary-General.</p>

<p>The Namibian case is notable for the close and sustained cooperation between various
elements of the UN system and UN member states. The Namibian case also expanded UN
practices. In addition to its traditional tasks of military peacekeeping and diplomacy, UN
forces monitored elections, maintained public order, provided basic administrative
services and legal advice, and offered humanitarian relief. </p>
