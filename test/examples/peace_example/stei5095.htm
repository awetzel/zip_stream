<p>Janet Gross Stein, &quot;Image, Identity and Conflict Resolution,&quot; in Managing
Global Chaos, eds. Chester Crocker, Fen Hampson and Pamela Aall, (Washington, D.C.: United
States Institute of Peace Press, 1996) pp 93-111.</em></p>

<p>Stein argues that enemy images play an important role in perpetuating and intensifying
conflict. Structural accounts of conflict do not recognize the importance of enemy images
and stereotypes. Stein turns to social psychology to describe how enemy images form, and
how they can be changed.</p>

<h3>Development of Enemy Images</h3>

<p>&quot;An image refers to a set of beliefs or to the hypotheses and theories that an
individual or group is convinced are valid.&quot;[p. 94] When an image is held by a group,
it is called a stereotype. Enemy images and stereotypes are formed in response to the
basic human psychological need for identity, and as a result of group dynamics. A
significant part of an individual's personal identity consists of his or her social
identity, and so depends on group membership. Group identity tends to be defined by
contrast to other groups. &quot;Membership in a group leads to systematic comparison,
differentiation, and derogation of other groups.&quot;[p. 94] This sort of inter-group
conflict occurs even in the absence of material bases for conflict. </p>

<p>Not all inter-group conflict become violent, however. The author investigates those
factors which intensify enemy images and aggravate inter-group conflict. First, violent
conflict does not tend to arise among compatible identities. Every individual has multiple
identities; for instance, wife, mother, scholar, Canadian, Quebecois, etc. When such
identities are compatible, conflict is minimized. The more incompatible identities become,
the more likely violent conflict becomes. Second, material conditions of scarcity can
intensify existing identity conflicts. Third, violent conflict becomes more likely when
one identity is based on the refusal to recognize another identity -- when recognizing the
other's identity is felt to undermine one's own identity. Israeli and Palestinian
identities are often construed as mutually exclusive in this way. Common cognitive biases
also tend to intensify enemy images. Egocentric bias leads people to overestimate the
degree to which others' actions are directed at them. Hence they may perceive themselves
to be a target of the other's actions, even when the other is not actually directing
action toward them. People also tend to attribute others' actions to their character,
rather than their situation. Hence, they tend to see the other as bad, rather than as
constrained by difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>The international or domestic situation may also act to intensify enemy images.
Egocentric bias may cause a people to interpret other states' defensive acts as aggressive
acts, and so intensify their image of the other state as an enemy. Domestically, identity
conflicts are often exploited and exacerbated for political gain. This is easiest to do in
countries with existing deep divisions, or where elites tend to dominate the means of mass
communication.</p>

<h3>Persistence of Enemy Images</h3>

<p>Once in place, enemy images tend to be self-fulfilling and self-reinforcing. People
tend to act more aggressively based on their enemy image or stereotype. This aggressive
behavior is likely to provoke a hostile response, which is then simply taken as
confirmation of the initial stereotype.</p>

<p>The author observes that &quot;enemy images are also the product of deeply rooted
social and psychological needs and frequently serve the interests of important groups and
elites.&quot;[p. 98] Enemy images tend to occupy a central position in groups' belief
systems. Groups are highly resistant to changing their central beliefs; change tends to
begin with more marginal beliefs.</p>

<p>Finally, people tend to seek out information which confirms existing stereotypes, and
discount information which would challenge their stereotypes. They also tend to interpret
information about the other negatively, in ways which support their existing stereotypes. </p>

<h3>Changing Enemy Images</h3>

<p>Despite these difficulties, it is possible to change enemy images. Stereotypes may
change when their holders are presented with a large amount of disconfirming information
in a relatively short period. Stereotypes also change gradually over time. As discrepant
information arises, people write &quot;exceptions&quot; into the stereotype. Generally,
the less emotional attachment there is to an enemy image, the easier it is to change.</p>

<p>Stein draws on social psychology to describe the process of political learning, whereby
enemy stereotypes may be improved. The author defines learning as &quot;changes in enemy
images that promote conflict management, routinization, reduction and
resolution.&quot;[p.101] Stein argues that such political learning is best understood as a
process of trial-and-error experimentation, motivated by failure. To illustrate this
process, Stein uses the cases of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, and Soviet president
Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>

<p>There are a number of internal conditions which stimulate political learning.
Structural changes can open up opportunities for learning, but are not themselves a
sufficient cause of political learning. Similarly, changing political coalitions, or new
generations of leadership, may bring with them new images. None of these factors account
for the learning experienced by Gorbachev and Sadat, however. </p>

<p>Stein argues that two factors motivated Gorbachev and Sadat to change their respective
enemy images. First, both were deeply committed to domestic reforms, and ongoing
international conflicts stood in the way of pursuing such reforms. Second, both leaders
had experienced the failure of various alternatives to negotiation and accommodation of
their opponents.</p>

<p>These factors motivated Gorbachev and Sadat to search out new information on their
opponents, and to experiment with different enemy images. &quot;Both began with a small
change in image, moved tentatively to small actions, accepted feedback, learned and
initiated a new series of actions that generated further feedback and change.&quot;[p.
102]</p>

<p>Stein suggests two strategies for purposefully altering enemy images. In both cases,
only one party is needed to initiate change. First, a leader may make an irrevocable
commitment. Sadat's 1977 trip to Jerusalem is an example of this technique. This strategy
faces two difficulties. It can be difficult to design a suitable commitment; one which has
a high cost and is irrevocable. And pursuing such a strategy requires a relatively high
degree of independence from domestic political constraints.</p>

<p>Second, incremental change may be encouraged by using variations on the GRIT technique.
One side announces its intention to engage in conciliatory actions, and then does so. If
the other side responds favorably, further conciliatory actions are taken. The goal is to
produce a gradual mutual improvement in each other's enemy images. A variation on this
strategy has one side, to be &quot;slow to retaliate and slow to return to
conciliation.&quot;[p. 104-5] To date, GRIT-based techniques have shown more experimental
promise than actual use.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Stein argues that &quot;In both enduring interstate rivalries and bitter ethnic
conflicts, interests are shaped by images, which are in turn partially shaped by
identity.&quot;[p. 105] Conflicts tend to arise when identities are threatened. Effective
conflict resolution then entails securing identities. Currently, the most common method of
securing threatened identities is through mutual recognition coupled with political
separation. Sadat's recognition of Israel and Israel's recognition of the legitimacy of
Palestine identity are examples of this approach. A second method involves creating
interdependent, multi-ethnic coalitions. In both approaches, &quot;the core of the
solution lies in the often-difficult decision by senior leaders to acknowledge, respect,
and accommodate different identities and to share political power.&quot;[p. 106]</p>

<p>Stein remains optimistic about the potential for such acknowledgment and accommodation.
She reminds us that identities are socially constructed, and hence are open to
reconstruction and reinterpretation over time. Identities also tend to share some very
general norms, such as fairness, reciprocity, and compassion. Appeals to such very basic
norms may be useful in promoting positive reinterpretations of identities.</p>
