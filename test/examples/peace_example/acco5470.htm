<p>The article describes the issues discussed during a conference on war crimes in
Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge, an extremely nationalistic communist organization, took power
from the US supported government of Lon Nol in 1975. April 17, 1975 was declared the
beginning of the year &quot;Zero&quot; of a new age &quot;in which there would be no
families, no schools, no books, no learning, no holidays, no music -- only work and
death&quot; (p. 2). Three million people were resettled to rural areas from the capital
and a campaign to eliminate of any signs of the country's colonial and royalist past
began. During the 1975-1979 genocide two million people perished. In 1993 the Khmer Rouge
boycotted the elections. Its destabilizing actions continue to threaten the new regime.
Prosecution of Khmer Rouge leaders might further destabilize the country. Thus, current
Cambodian leaders are faced with the dilemma of whether to pursue justice or stability.
Conference participants agreed that for reconciliation to happen, the Khmer Rouge should
be prosecuted for its crimes. There are several options available: creation of
international criminal tribunal, &quot;a non-criminal proceeding before the International
Court of Justice, domestic prosecution before Cambodian Courts and the establishment of an
international commission of inquiry which would gather material for further prosecution
(p. 3). Conference participants emphasized that the international community cannot
implement any actions without support from the Cambodian people and government. The first
step would be to assemble the evidence of violence committed by the Khmer Rouge, then to
bring the leaders of the party to justice. This would create a precedent of accountability
which could prevent this from happening again and encourage the process of reconciliation
and healing for those who suffered from the old regime, and for the Cambodian people in
general. </p>
