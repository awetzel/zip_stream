<p>Stewart, John, and Milt Thomas. &quot;Dialogic Listening: Sculpting Mutual
Meanings,&quot; in <i>Bridges Not Walls</i>, ed. John Stewart, 6th edition, (New York:
McGraw- Hill, 1995), pp. 184-201. </p>

<h4>Active or Empathic Listening</h4>

<p>Active or empathic listening stresses putting one's self in another's place. The goal
is to effectively understand and accurately interpret another's meanings. The authors
identify three problems with this sort of approach. </p>

<p>First, we cannot actually get inside another's mind or occupy their perspective. Nor
can we actually set aside our own perspective. Second, paraphrasing under this approach
can become a mere repeating back of the other's words, which tends to frustrate the other
person. Third, these approaches focus each participant's attention on the other's internal
psychological state, rather than focusing on the joint process and interaction of
communication.</p>

<h4>Dialogic Listening</h4>

<p>The authors contrast dialogic listening to active or empathic approaches. The dialogic
approach has four distinctive characteristics. First, it emphasizes conversation as a
shared activity. Usually people focus their attention on their own views in conversation.
Active listening overcompensates for this tendency by overemphasizing the need to focus
attention on the other's views. In contrast, in dialogic listening the focus is on
&quot;our&quot; views and the emerging product of the conversation. </p>

<p>Second, dialogic listening stresses an open-ended, playful attitude toward
conversation. The authors note that modern Western culture values &quot;hard&quot;
thinking which produces certainty, closure, and control. Speculative, metaphoric,
ambiguous thinking is generally devalued. Dialogic listening seeks to recover and tap into
the productive creativity of this &quot;softer&quot; style of thinking. In contrast to the
&quot;hard&quot; style of most conversations, the &quot;soft&quot; style of dialogic
listening requires modesty, humility, trust, and a robust recognition of the other party
as a choice-maker. </p>

<p>Third, in dialogic listening, the parties focus on what is happening between them,
rather than each party focusing on what is going on within the mind of the other. Stewart
and Thomas say, &quot;instead of trying to infer internal 'psychic' states from the talk,
when you are listening dialogically you join with the other person in the process of
co-creating meaning between you.&quot;[p. 192]</p>

<p>Finally, dialogic listening focuses on the present, rather than primarily on future
goals or on past events. Dialogic listening requires that one be fully present to the
process and one's conversation partner. This attitude of being-in-the-present helps each
party to unify his or her actions, intentions, and speech. It can also reduce power
differences.</p>

<h4>Applications</h4>

<p>The most important element in applying dialogic listening is the participant's
attitude. The dialogic listener must stay focused on staying present, and on the
open-ended process they are jointly creating. Dialogic listening occurs when these
attitudes are coupled with the following techniques: 

<ul>
  <li>1. Dialogic listeners should encourage each other to say more, to further explore and
    explicate their views and questions. The authors find that requests to &quot;say
    more&quot; seldom produce mere reputation, and generally produces greater clarity and
    detail. </li>
  <li>2. Dialogic listeners should also use, extend, and share metaphors. Such use of
    metaphors is typical of the softer style of thinking, which this approach seeks to foster.
    Exploring metaphors can help to reveal new perspectives on an issue or situation. </li>
  <li>3. Dialogic listening also makes use of paraphrasing. The authors recommend asking one's
    conversation partner to paraphrase one's comments. Dialogic listeners use paraphrasing not
    just to repeat what the other said but also to interpret and respond. Again, the goal here
    is to keep the conversation open and focused on the interaction. </li>
  <li>4. The authors also encourage dialogic listeners to explore the context of each other's
    claims. Explore the circumstances and desires which surround ideas, feelings and opinions.
    Filling out the context facilitates shared understanding. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Drawbacks to Dialogic Listening</h4>

<p>Stewart and Thomas conclude by responding to common objections to their dialogic
approach. One objection is that dialogic listening is too time consuming. The authors
point out that this approach can be pursued in only half-again the time that poorer
communication takes. Moreover, dialogic listening can lead to more efficient communication
in future interactions. Many people find that the increased quality in communication
balances the additional time costs. </p>

<p>Dialogic listening can seem awkward and possibly manipulative to those who are
unfamiliar with the approach. If you encounter this resistance, the authors suggest first
that you re-examine you own motivations to make sure you aren't being manipulative or
insincere. Otherwise, people can usually be put at ease with some brief explanation of
your non-standard behavior. </p>

<p>Finally, dialogic listening is very demanding. It requires a lot of effort and
attention. Sometimes people will resist these demands. One may encourage others to
participate in the dialogic approach, but must know when to stop pushing.</p>
