<p>Touval describes the failure of diplomatic attempts to prevent war and maintain a
unified Yugoslavia. He argues that these efforts at preventative diplomacy lacked clarity
and credibility. Based on his analysis of the Yugoslavian case, Touval draws five lessons
for future attempts at preventative diplomacy.</p>

<h3>Yugoslavia and the Failure of Preventative Diplomacy</h3>

<p>Western nations have long recognized the nationalist tensions within Yugoslavia. During
the Cold War era, the West saw Yugoslavia as an ally in preventing Soviet expansion. For
this reason, western diplomatic efforts maintained a sharp focus on maintaining a unified
Yugoslavia. Under Tito's rule, nationalist tendencies were repressed and unity maintained.</p>

<p>As expected, those nationalist tensions resurfaced with Tito's death in 1980. Croatian,
Muslim and Serbian factions began to agitate for secession. By this time the Cold War was
ending, and western priorities were changing. While the western nations still wanted a
unified Yugoslavia, they were also increasingly concerned with promoting democratization
and economic reforms. Western nations perceived these goal as compatible. Democracy, it
was thought, would &quot;redress human rights, alleviate ethnic tensions, and keep the
country united.&quot;[p. 405] Ironically, democratic and economic reforms appear to have
fueled the conflict. Economic reforms resulted in short-term hardships. The frustration
and dissatisfaction caused by economic hardships was in turn exploited by faction leaders
and used to fuel nationalistic fervor. Democratic reforms allowed the widespread electoral
victory of candidates running on extremist nationalist platforms.</p>

<p>By 1990, the breakup of Yugoslavia seemed inevitable. In December 1990 Slovenia voted
to secede at the end of June 1991, unless some confederacy agreement could be reached in
the interim. Western nations still hoped that open warfare could be avoided, and a
negotiated separation achieved. Unfortunately, western diplomatic efforts to prevent war
failed.</p>

<p>Touval argues that western preventative diplomacy failed in Yugoslavia for two main
reasons. First, the western nations did not project clear goals for Yugoslavia. The West's
message was ambiguous, and Touval argues that this ambiguity &quot;stemmed from the West's
definition of goals in terms of broad values, some of which were contradictory in the
context of time and place.&quot;[p. 406] In the current Yugoslavian context,
democratization was allowing people to vote to secede, and break up the nation.
Maintaining Yugoslavian unity required repressing nationalist views, which would be both
anti-democratic and would likely entail further violations of human rights.</p>

<p>Second, Touval argues that western diplomatic effort lacked credible leverage. Western
nations attempted to enforce their goals via economic incentives and threats. Economic
incentives were practically the only tool available at the time. However, economic
pressure was not effective. Withholding economic assistance contributed to the popular
frustrations which were in turn exploited to fuel nationalist sentiments. The ambiguity of
western goals made it unclear under what conditions aid would be given or withheld. The
credibility of economic threats was further undermined by political divisions within the
European community. &quot;Finally,&quot; Touval notes, &quot;economic punishments (or
rewards) were not well attuned to the psychology of the nationalist leaders.&quot;[p. 407]
The factions were primarily concerned with issues of physical security and group identity.
Economic prosperity was of only secondary concern. Touval suggests two reasons why the
western nations did not attempt mediation of the conflict. One, mediation would have
implied tacit acceptance of Croatia and Slovenia as sovereign powers. Two, mediation would
have constituted interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. Moreover,
Touval argues that even had it been attempted, mediation would have likely been
unsuccessful. Neutral, non-intrusive mediation would have simply been perceived as further
western equivocation and ambiguity, hence encouraging the various sides to intensify their
positions. Directed mediation in which the mediating party suggests a settlement relies on
credible threats and promises. However the West at that time lacked credible, effective
leverage.</p>

<h3>Lessons for Preventative Diplomacy</h3>

<p>Touval draws five lessons for future attempts at preventative diplomacy from the
Yugoslavian case. First, the international community must prioritize its goals. By
demanding both democratization and unity, the West presented Yugoslavia with a confusing
and contradictory mandate. The West's demands would have been clearer had they ranked the
importance of these goals. </p>

<p>Second, the international community should avoid presenting vague, equivocal or
ambiguous goals. They should &quot;refrain from reciting broad values and instead define
in concrete terms what they expect from the disputants.&quot;[p. 414] Touval concedes that
this may be difficult. Generally it is easier to generate international agreement on basic
values than on specific proposals. However, goals must be clear to be credible. The
Yugoslavian case also shows that economic threats and incentives are likely to be
ineffective in cases of ethnic conflict. Group identity, historic grievances, and physical
security issues tend to overshadow economic concerns in such situations. Economic
incentives have little relevance to the disputants' concerns, and so produce little
leverage.</p>

<p>The Yugoslavian conflict reveals an even more basic lesson about timing. Touval argues
the ethnic conflicts are an exception to the conventional wisdom, which says that
conflicts are easier to prevent than end. Unlike many other types of conflict, in ethnic
conflicts the participants tend to become fully committed to their positions very early
on. What is worse, Touval suggests, is that early preventive interventions are
&quot;likely to be launched at a highly inauspicious moment after the parties have
committed themselves to their goals, but before they have reached a hurting stalemate that
might dispose them to rethink their policies.&quot;[p. 415]</p>

<p>Finally, Touval notes that nations are often unwilling to commit themselves, their
resources, and possibly their citizen's lives to preventing foreign conflicts. Yet without
such commitment, diplomatic threats and incentives lack force and credibility. For
preventive diplomacy to be effective, it must be backed by the strong commitment of the
intervening nations.</p>
