<p>Miscommunication in conflict can lead to serious consequences. It becomes very
important to clearly define one's offers or demands in messages sent to the opponent. It
also is useful to be aware of how the opponent would interpret the message.</p>

<p>An example of this is the messages sent by US government to the government in Hanoi
with the threat of continuing the bombing of North Vietnamese positions unless they would
stop supplying partisans in South Vietnam, during the Vietnam war. The message did not
give the North Vietnamese a clear understanding of what they should do in order for the
bombing to stop. They realized that if they stopped all the supplies, the US would stop
the bombing. However, they also knew that &quot;this was more than the situation
required,&quot; but they did not know &quot;how <em>much</em> more&quot; (p. 47). The US,
in an attempt to be reasonable, was asking for gradual reduction in supplies. However, the
way the message was formulated, made it sound to North Vietnamese that they would be
bombed anyway. </p>

<p>The lack of success with the bombing message made US officials feel that the same fate
would follow the cease-fire proposal. As a result, it was not offered and the war
continued. Thus, it would have been beneficial for conflict de-escalation if the US has
not based its decisions upon its own message, but upon the interpretation of it by the
opponent. </p>
