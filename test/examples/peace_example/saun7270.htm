<p>Harold Saunders, &quot;Prenegotiation and Circum-negotiation: Arenas of the Peace
Process,&quot; in Managing Global Chaos, eds. Chester Crocker, Fen Hampson and Pamela
Aall, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1996) pp. 419-432.</em>Saunders
argues that the peace process includes more than just official negotiations. &quot;Peace
requires a process of building constructive relationships in a civil society not just
negotiating, signing, and ratifying a formal agreement.&quot;[p. 420] Saunders describes
the different arenas in which the peace process is pursued, and describes the basic phases
of the peace process. </p>

<h3>Prenegotiation and Circum-Negotiation</h3>

<p>Prenegotiation refers to &quot;the times and the tasks apart from negotiation that have
the purpose of beginning, sustaining, and nourishing a peace process by changing
relationships and paving the way for negotiation or other peaceful steps to resolve
conflict.&quot;[p. 421] Since the term 'prenegotiation' has been used by some theorists to
describe a fairly specific set of tasks undertaken just prior to official negotiations,
Saunders prefers to use the term 'circum- negotiation.' While formal negotiations may play
a role in the peace process, many modern conflicts are not amenable to negotiation. People
are often unwilling to negotiate over issues of identity, justice, security, and dignity.
For this reason the goal of pre- or circum-negotiation is not just to start negotiations,
but to &quot;start a political process that can change relationships and lead to the end
of violence, to peace, and to reconciliation.&quot;[p. 421]</p>

<h3>Arenas for Peace Building</h3>

<p>Saunders views the peace process as spanning four different but interconnected arenas.
The most familiar is the official arena of government negotiations and diplomacy. Second
is the quasi-official arena, where individuals and groups cooperate closely with the
government, but have no official status or authority to negotiate. In 1993 the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process began with such quasi-official meetings in what became
known as the Norway Channel. </p>

<p>Public dialogue is a relatively new arena for building peace. Public dialogues seek to
&quot;engage representative citizens from the conflicting parties in designing steps to be
taken in the political arena to change perceptions and stereotypes, to create a sense that
peace may be possible, and to involve more and more of their compatriots.&quot;[p. 423] A
final arena is civil society at large. Civil conflicts tend to fragment society and sunder
relationships. In order to achieve peace, relationships between and across group
differences must be reestablished, and social coherence restored. </p>

<p>The author argues that no one of these arenas is primary. They are interconnected and
complementary. To be effective the peace process must be pursued in each arena. Saunders
also notes that third parties intervention may be helpful in any of these arenas.</p>

<h3>Phases of the Peace Process</h3>

<p>The peace process can be described in terms of five cyclical phases. Successfully
concluding the final phase often opens the way to begin the first phase in some new area
or aspect of conflict. Each of these phases can be pursued within each arena. However,
each arena approaches each phase in a somewhat different manner. Saunders offers examples
of each phase as it occurs within the public and the official arena.</p>

<p>In the opening phase of the peace process citizens and officials make the decision to
work toward peace, and attempt to define the conflict problem. In the public arena,
individuals seek ways to reach out to members of the other side, and to open a dialogue.
Such direct contact is often politically impractical in the official arena. During the
first phase the official arena focuses on researching and framing issues. </p>

<p>In phase two people move on to mapping relationships and issues. In the public arena
maps are developed in direct communication with the opponent. In the official arena such
mapping is often carried on unilaterally. Often the political costs of speaking with the
enemy are still too high at this phase to permit direct official communication. </p>

<p>Phase three seeks to solidify the will to pursue and implement a joint solution to the
conflict in question. In public dialogues, participants seek to develop specific ways of
changing conflicted relationships, and to decide which ways should be pursued. In the
official arena, this phase is devoted to making substantive and logistic preparations for
negotiations. Some authors use the term 'prenegotiation' narrowly, to refer simply to this
phase in the official arena. </p>

<p>Phase four is the negotiation phase. In the official arena, negotiators attempt to
generate a written agreement which presents a formal solution to the conflict at hand. The
public arena addresses relationships more directly in this phase. Public dialogues seek to
&quot;design a scenario of interacting steps which can be taken in the political arena to
change troublesome relationships.&quot;[p. 430] </p>

<p>In the fifth phase citizens and officials act cooperatively to implement their
agreements. Individuals begin to taking the interacting steps toward changed relationships
which had been developed over the course of the dialogue. Governments act to implement the
formal terms agreed to during negotiations. Saunders points out that the official process
deals primarily with formal issues, such as changing judicial and physical arrangements.
Dialogue in the public arena focuses primarily on changing human relationships. Since the
goal of the peace process is to improve violently conflicting relationships, public
participation is crucial to the success of the overall peace process.</p>
