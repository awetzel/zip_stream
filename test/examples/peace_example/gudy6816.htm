<p>William Gudykunst and Young Yun Kim, &quot;Communicating With Strangers: An Approach to
Intercultural Communication,&quot; in Bridges Not Walls, ed. John Stewart, 6th edition,
(New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995), pp. 429-442. </em></p>

<p>The authors begin by observing that &quot;we communicate the way we do because we are
raised in a particular culture and learn its language, rules, and norms.&quot;[p. 430]
Different cultures (and subcultures) may have different rules and norms. The authors argue
that understanding the other's culture facilitates cross-cultural communication.</p>

<p>Gudykunst and Kim believe that intercultural communication can be understood via the
same basic variables and processes used to describe other forms of communication. All
communication occurs between people who have varying degree of familiarity with each
other. The key factor in understanding intercultural communication is the concept of the
stranger. </p>

<h3>Understanding Communication</h3>

<p>Strangeness and familiarity make up a continuum. The authors use the term
&quot;stranger&quot; to refer to those people at the most unfamiliar end of the continuum.
Thus anyone could be considered a stranger, given a sufficiently foreign context. A
stranger has limited knowledge of their new environment - of its norms and values. And in
turn, the locals have little knowledge of the stranger - of her beliefs, interests and
habits. Generally speaking, communication with another involves predicting or anticipating
their responses. When communicating with someone familiar we are usually confident in our
anticipation, and may not even notice that we are making such predictions. In contrast,
when we communicate with strangers we are more aware of the range of their possible
responses, and of the uncertainty of our predictions.</p>

<p>Communicative predictions are based on data from three levels. First is the cultural
level. This level involves information about the other's culture, its dominant values and
norms. This is often the only level of information available when communicating with a
stranger. Even so, a better understanding of the stranger's culture yields better
predictions. The second level of information is sociocultural. This includes data about
the other's group membership, or the groups to which they seek to belong. This type of
information is the predominate data used in intracultural communication. Finally there is
psychocultural data. This is information about the individual's characteristics, and is
the sort of data most relevant to communication with friends.</p>

<p>We understand such data by the process of social cognition. Social cognition is a
dialectical process which involves both grouping particulars into categories based on
their similarities, and of distinguishing individuals from their categories based on their
differences. Communication with strangers often relies too heavily on categorization
(stereotyping). Such stereotypes may be inaccurate, or may not apply to the present
individual. To improve communication with strangers we must pay attention to their unique,
individual features. The authors argue that effective communication with strangers
requires an increased awareness of our communication behaviors. First, we tend to
categorize things automatically, and so we are less aware of doing it. It takes more of
our conscious awareness to differentiate particular individuals from their stereotypical
categories. Second, much of our daily communication follows familiar scripts, and so we
are not consciously aware of that communication behavior. We cannot rely on such familiar
scripts and norms when communicating with a stranger. Our communication will be improved
if we recognize that familiar scripts do not apply, and seek to modify our communication
behaviors accordingly. </p>

<h3>Uncertainty and Anxiety</h3>

<p>Generally, in communication, we seek to reduce uncertainty. Communication with
strangers involves relatively greater degrees of uncertainty, due to the difficulty in
predicting a stranger's responses. We experience uncertainty with regard to the stranger's
attitudes, feelings and beliefs. We are also uncertain of how to explain the stranger's
behavior. Motivation to reduce this uncertainty is more acute when we expect to have
further interactions with the stranger, or when they are a potential source of benefit.</p>

<p>We may reduce our uncertainty and increase the accuracy of our predictions by gaining
more information about the stranger. The authors describe three basic strategies for
gathering such information. One may passively observe the stranger. One may actively seek
out information from other friends of the stranger, or from books. Finally, one may seek
information directly from the stranger by interacting with them and asking questions.
Also, offering information about one's self often prompts reciprocal offerings of
information from another.</p>

<p>The increased uncertainty in interactions with strangers is accompanied by higher
levels of anxiety, as we anticipate a wider array of possible negative outcomes. We may
worry about damage to our self-esteem from feeling confused and out of control. We may
fear the possibility of being incompetent, or being exploited. We may worry about being
perceived negatively by the stranger. And we may worry that interacting with a stranger
will bring disapproval from members of our own group. Generally these anxieties can be
reduced by paying more conscious attention to the communication process, and by gathering
more information on the stranger. The authors add a further caution. Generally,
individuals tend to explain their own behavior by reference to the situation. Observers
tend to attribute an individual's behavior to elements of that individual's character.
When interacting with strangers we are especially likely to attribute their behavior to
their character, and then to view their character as typical of their culture (or race,
etc.). That is, we are especially likely to interpret a stranger's behavior in light of
our stereotypes about what &quot;those kind of people&quot; are like.</p>
