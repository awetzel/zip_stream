<p>The 1971 U.S.-Japan Monetary Crisis</p>

<p>Selection from: Raymond Cohen, Negotiating Across Cultures: Communication Obstacles in
International Diplomacy, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1991),
pp. 52</p>

<p>The 1971 U.S.-Japan monetary crisis illustrates the effectiveness of taking differing
cultural communication styles into account. In 1971 the U.S. was trying to persuade a
reluctant Japan to revalue its currency. Japanese political decision making values
consensus building. Culturally their negotiating style is low key and relationship based.
Japanese negotiators do not react well to aggressive pressure tactics. </p>

<p>Secretary of the Treasury John Connally accommodated the Japanese style. His first
visit was devoted to building relationships. &quot;Wisely, Connally made no attempt on
this visit to negotiate, let alone put pressure on his hosts, but insisted that his aim
was to exchange opinions and, picking up a phrase used by Japanese diplomats, 'to improve
mutual understanding.'&quot;[p. 52] As he visited various Japanese officials, Connally
explained American desires for currency revaluation, being careful to present them as
interests rather than as demands or positions. This low key approach gave Japanese
officials a better understanding of American needs, and made it easier for them to
compromise without losing face.</p>
