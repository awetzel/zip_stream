<p>John Paul Lederach, &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;A Framework for Building
Peace,&quot; chapts. in Preparing for Peace: Conflict Transformation Across
Cultures(Syracuse, New York: Syracuse University Press, 1995), pp 3-23. </em></p>

<p>Lederach's experience with cross-cultural mediation training has raised questions about
the relation between culture and conflict, and about the purpose and practice of mediation
training. Based on his experiences, Lederach suggests a new approach to mediation
training. This essay summarizes the opening chapters of the text. These chapter focus on
the relation between culture and conflict, and describe a framework for understanding
conflict. Subsequent chapters of the text are devoted to explaining and applying the
author's approach to conflict and mediation training.</p>

<h3>Understanding Culture and Conflict</h3>

<p>Lederach's thesis is that conflict resolution theorists &quot;need to explore
critically at a much deeper level both the content and the approach to conflict resolution
training and its relationship to culture.&quot;[6] He argues that cultural differences
have been wrongly treated as fairly superficial. </p>

<p>Lederach identifies and criticizes three basic assumptions about culture implicit in
current approaches to cross-cultural mediation training. First, current approaches tend to
assume that current models of conflict and resolution are universally applicable, needing
only fairly minor adjustments to accommodate cultural differences. Second, they assume
that the cultural aspects of conflict and resolution can be accommodated by adopting the
appropriate mediation techniques. Third, the appropriate techniques are simply added into
the already trained mediator's repertoire of skills, and so cross-cultural training is
usually presented as a form of advanced training.</p>

<p>Lederach's own views about culture, conflict, and the relation between them, are based
in a social constructionist approach. In this view, &quot;social conflict emerges and
develops on the basis of the meaning and interpretation people involved attach to action
and events...From this starting point, conflict is connected to meaning, meaning to
knowledge, and knowledge is rooted in culture.&quot;[8] Cultural differences stand at the
very root of conflict. Current models of conflict may then need substantial revision to be
applicable across cultures. The mere addition of special techniques to the mediator's
established repertoire cannot be adequate to deal with cultural differences, which are now
seen to affect the very nature of the conflict.</p>

<h3>Developing a Conflict Framework</h3>

<p>I order to better understand the purpose and practice of mediation training, one must
first explore the purpose and goals of the field of conflict resolution more generally.
Given that culture provides the ultimate foundation of conflict, what should the goal of
conflict resolution be? In order to answer this question Lederach develops a framework for
understanding conflict. </p>

<p>The author's framework contains three main elements. It sees conflicts as long-term
processes, which occur in the context of ongoing relationships. It employs adequate
descriptive language. And, it incorporates an appreciation of the place of paradox in
understanding conflict and peacemaking.</p>

<h3>The Long-Term View</h3>

<p>The long-term view of conflict is based on two variables: balance of power, and
awareness of conflicting interests and needs. The processes of conflict and peace can both
be understood as occurring within the matrix described by these two variables. Given this
analysis, peacemakers face different tasks at different points in the process. When
awareness is low the peacemaker should seek to educate. They should engage in advocacy and
confrontation when power imbalance is great and awareness increasing. Finally, mediation
is needed when awareness is high and power balanced sufficiently to permit negotiation.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of all these peacemaking tasks is restructuring relationships to
produce just and peaceful relations. Notice that in this view bringing up and confronting
latent conflict is not seen as increasing conflict, but is seen as an intrinsic part of
the larger peacemaking process.</p>

<h3>An Adequate Descriptive Language</h3>

<p>Lederach also feels that an adequate descriptive language is important for an full
understanding of conflict and peacemaking. Originally, the task of peacemaking was
described as conflict resolution. The author criticizes this description on a number of
points. Resolution implies that conflict is undesirable, and should be eliminated where
possible. Also, speaking in terms of resolution does not recognize the ongoing nature of
the relationships in which conflict naturally occurs. Moreover, this terminology does not
encourage recognition of the uses of confrontation in pursuit of justice (which is the
basis of real peace). It tends to mistake the lack of overt confrontation for peace. The
term &quot;conflict management&quot; has in many places replaced &quot;resolution&quot;.
This new terminology has the advantage of recognizing the ongoing nature of conflict.
However, it tends to focus too narrowly on technical management skills, neglecting the
ultimate goal of justice in favor of controlling volatility.</p>

<p>Recently the goal of peacemaking has been described as conflict transformation.
Lederach favors this description. First, the language of transformation captures the
dialectical nature of conflict, and reflects a holistic approach to understanding conflict
processes. Second, speaking in terms of transformation recognizes the positive potential
of conflict and is consistent with the social science view that conflict &quot;moves
through certain predictable phases transforming relationships and social
organization.&quot;[17] It captures conflict's potential to change parties' perceptions of
self and other. This language also implies the prescription that the transformative
effects of conflict should be channeled toward producing positive systemic change.
Lederach concludes that &quot;transformation as a concept is both descriptive of the
conflict dynamics and prescriptive of the overall purpose that building peace
pursues.&quot;[18] and so is the most adequate descriptive language available. </p>

<h3>The Place of Paradox</h3>

<p>Lederach argues for an appreciation of the place of paradox in peacemaking. He says,
&quot;A paradoxical approach suggests the energy of the [irreconcilable] ideas is enhanced
if they are held together, like two sides of a coin.&quot;[19] The author describes four
such pairs of irreconcilable ideas which he has found to be helpful in understanding
conflict, and which are &quot;held together&quot; within the transformative approach.</p>

<p>First Lederach describes the tension between the pursuit of personal transformation or
systemic transformation. He argues that there are not exclusive options. Instead, they are
interdependent. Systemic transformation facilitates personal transformation. Personal
transformation promotes systemic transformation. Both must be pursued together to produce
real social change.</p>

<p>Similarly, the demands of justice and mercy are often felt to be in tension with each
other. Lederach explains that these two elements are &quot;held together&quot; within the
relational view of the transformative approach. Justice requires building and rebuilding
just communities. Communities are united by ties of trust, compassion and mercy. And so
justice requires mercy.</p>

<p>Often the goal of individual empowerment seems to be in conflict with the task of
cultivating recognition of individuals' interdependence. Individual's independence is
thought to undermine the interdependence which brings communities together. Dependance on
the community in turn seems to weaken the individual. The transformative approach however
conceives of empowerment as empowerment to act within and through a community, and so
reconciles this opposition also.</p>

<p>Finally, Lederach describes the paradox posed by commitment to process versus
commitment to outcome. Which is more important, the means or the ends? He calls this the
&quot;Gandhi Dilemma,&quot; and notes that the transformative approach similarly adopts a
Gandhian solution. Commitment to process becomes understood as a commitment to a
particular philosophy and lifestyle: the pursuit of Truth and the restoration of
relationships. The desired outcome is also similarly reconceptualized as achieving
commitment to Truth and restoration.</p>
