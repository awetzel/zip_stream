<p>Jacob Bercovitch, &quot;Understanding Mediation's Role in Preventative Diplomacy,&quot;
Negotiation Journal, 12:3 (July 1996), p. 241-258. </em></p>

<p>Bercovitch examines 241 international conflicts occurring from 1945 to 1990. Mediation
was attempted, often multiple times, in 60% of those conflicts. Bercovitch identifies
nearly 600 mediation attempts made over the course of those conflicts. Based on an
analysis of these mediation attempts, the author identifies a number of factors which
correlate strongly with successful mediation.</p>

<p>Democratic states are often believed to be less likely to engage in conflict than non-
democratic states. However, Bercovitch finds that once engaged in conflict, the political
make-up of a state has little impact on that state's likelihood of accepting mediation.</p>

<p>Bercovitch also found that mediation was most likely to succeed when the adversaries
both had well defined and legitimate identities. Mediation was most successful (64%) where
one or both of adversaries had no significant cultural minority. Mediation was least
successful (38%) where one or both of adversaries had a significant cultural minority.
Power disparities between adversaries were also a significant factor. Mediation was most
successful (51%) where there was little difference in power. Mediation was least
successful (33%) where the power difference was great. </p>

<p>Regarding the timing of mediation, Bercovitch finds that &quot;preventative mediation
is more effective when it is initiated early, but not before the parties' positions have
crystallized.&quot;[p. 251] Low fatality rates (100-500) were correlated with relatively
high mediation success rates (64%). High fatality rates (10,000+) were correlated with low
mediation success rates (39%).</p>

<p>Bercovitch finds that preventative mediation appears to be more effective at addressing
certain issues than others. Resource disputes had the highest rate of successful mediation
(70%), followed closely by ethnic disputes (67%). Next came ideology disputes (50%),
followed by sovereignty disputes (45%) and lastly security disputes (41%). Many authors
have argued that impartiality is a crucial ingredient to a mediator's success. Bercovitch
argues that &quot;effective mediation is more a matter of resource utilization, leverage,
and influence than it is a matter of impartiality.&quot;[p. 254] Mediators who employ
directive strategies are more likely to be successful (52%) than mediators who employ a
communication-facilitative strategy (32%).</p>

<p>The mediation environment is also a factor influencing mediation success. Mediation was
most successful when it occurred on the mediators' territory (54%) or on neutral territory
(50%). Mediation was less successful when held in the parties territory (45%) and least
successful when it moved between a number of sites (36%).</p>
