<h1>Urban Heights Collaboration</h1>

<h2>Barbara Gray</h2>

<p>Selection from: Barbara Gray, Collaborating: Finding Common Ground for Multiparty
Problems, (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1989), pp. 95-111. </em></p>

<p>In the early 1970s, Urban Heights was a racially integrated community with a tradition
of strong civic involvement by its residents. In 1974, a citizen's group became concerned
that lending institutions were beginning to disinvest in their community. Disinvestment
generally leads to resegregation and neighborhood decline. Specifically, the citizen's
group suspected that lenders were restricting home mortgage loans in the community, a
practice known as redlining. The group's research suggested that disinvestment was
occurring. However, lenders denied any charge of redlining. While the citizen's framed
their concerns as a matter of community preservation and racial discrimination, the
lenders saw it as simply a matter of making sound investments. The conflict threatened to
escalate.</p>

<p>Rebuffed by the lenders, the citizen's group appealed to the city government to
intervene.</p>

<p>In response, the city convened a Committee on Residential Lending (CORL) to investigate
possible disinvestment. CORL members included representatives from lenders, realtors,
citizens, and local government. The city manager chaired meetings and set the agenda. The
city manager thus expanded the dialogue beyond the initial disputants to include other
affected parties.</p>

<p>Initially CORL members had difficulty identifying the central problem. Early CORL
agendas tended to focus on proposed solutions rather than on defining the problem. The
city manager's control of the agenda and ground rules was key to CORL's eventual success.
The manager assured each group of adequate time to raise its concerns, and managed
discussions to avoid escalation while still raising critical issues.</p>

<p>Still, after some months of difficult discussions and disagreements, CORL members had
not settled on a common definition of the central problem. Here again the city manger
played a key role. The city manager distilled a list of issues for the CORL to pursue from
the earlier discussions. The manager also appointed subcommittees to investigate each
issue, gather data, and make recommendations to CORL. . </p>

<p>As the different stakeholders worked closely together in the subcommittees, their
positions began to soften. CORL was finally able to agree on a common definition of the
central problem, and to develop solutions. In order to implement those solutions CORL
needed to gain the cooperation of a number of constituencies, including lending
institutions, federal agencies, and the city council. CORL had broad community support,
through the association of the original citizen's group with the main community congress.
One of CORL's' realtor members also served on the city council, and so was influence those
constituencies. As CORL's base of support widened, they were to apply greater pressure to
particular constituencies. CORL was persuasive, and their plans have been put into effect.</p>
