<p><big>As conflict emerges, opponents are very likely to misperceive at least somewhat
the other's goals, motives and attributes. As the role of enemy is thrust upon one's
opponent, it is seen to behave pretty much as one would expect an opponent to do. A
self-fulfilling prophecy begins to operate and the perceived enemy becomes a real one.
Opposing sides create the conflict in part by how they make sense of what is happening
between them. Conflict reality depends heavily on how the conflict parties explain to
themselves and others what is going on. The parties may see their respective goals as
highly incompatible where in fact they are not. But acting on such misperceptions may
actually make them so. </big></p>
