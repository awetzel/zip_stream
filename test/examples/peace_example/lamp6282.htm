<p>Prejudice is created by many factors, some of which cause more extensive and
deep-rooted damage than others. Often, prejudice is easily erased unless originally
prompted by a traumatic experience. However, when cultural attitudes are strengthened by
real experiences, prejudice is much more difficult to treat. Some factors that strengthen
prejudice are fear, guilt, shame, politeness, tolerance, and moralizing. This article
discusses workshops designed to help people learn to deal with discrimination when they
experience it, and how to prevent themselves from participating in prejudice against other
groups of people.</p>

<p>These workshops are based on a Freudian theory, in which prejudice has an
&quot;aim&quot; and an &quot;object.&quot; The object of prejudice is people identified as
inferior in one's own culture, while &quot;the aim of prejudicial behavior and attitudes
is to discharge feelings of rage, which stem from internalized experiences of hurt&quot;
(4). In other words, we discriminate against others because we ourselves feel powerless
and inadequate.</p>

<p>The steps taken by the Mennonite Central Committee in their workshops on prejudice
reduction concentrate first on asking participants to focus on how they feel about
themselves and about other groups. Next, people are divided into pairs and asked to react
spontaneously to a word repeatedly thrown at them by their partner (i.e., one person
repeats the word Catholic, unemployed, Protestant, etc., and the other person verbally
responds without thinking). This exercise is then brought back to the large group and
discussed in the context of self censorship, honesty and feelings evoked by hearing
prejudicial statements about others, and more specifically about one's own cultural group.
The next step is the formation of small groups (caucuses) based on similar cultural
identity. The people in each group discuss similar life experiences, including hurt felt
by prejudice and discrimination. Finally, the caucuses again come together in a large
group and share their life experiences, particularly the hurt felt by prejudice.</p>

<p>The process described above helps people to shed their defensiveness, to understand
that everyone has both experienced and participated in prejudice, and to reflect on any
hurtful prejudice-related experiences. It also allows people to discuss personal
experiences and hear the life experiences of people from culturally different backgrounds
without presupposed attitudes. After these steps, if they have participated with open
minds, people are ready to turn inward and deal with their own feelings of powerlessness.</p>

<p>After the initial steps listed above, the Mennonite workshop uses three specific
exercises to attempt to deal with personal feelings of powerlessness and reduce prejudice
after the above initial steps: 1. Volunteers are asked to talk about prejudice directed at
them, a time when they interrupted an act of prejudice (at which time they are praised for
their action), and a time when they did not interrupt an act of prejudice; 2. Each caucus
brainstorms and lists negative statements that they never want to hear again in reference
to themselves, then the larger group chooses several of these statements and learns how to
&quot;challenge the statement[s] without leaving the speaker humiliated;&quot; and 3. The
groups brainstorm ways of reducing prejudicial behavior within their own organization(s).</p>
