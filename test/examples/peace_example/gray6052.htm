<p>Generally, any proposal to create a hazardous waste facility will be greeted with
intense community opposition. While the Hawkins Point landfill in Maryland only operated
for a year, it is considered a success in that it was built at all.</p>

<p>In the Hawkins Point case, the target site was already in use as a hazardous landfill.
The surrounding area was largely industrial, and was slated for further industrial
development. The nearest community consisted of twenty-two homes and a church. After two
years of community negotiations over construction clean-up, assessment of existing
hazards, royalty payments to the community and employment opportunities, the state
eventually decided to &quot;buy out&quot; and relocate the community. Relocation would
cost roughly $3 million. Environmental groups agreed to the development in exchange for
agreements to clean up the previously existing sites.</p>
