Conciliation Quarterly. Summer 1995. Pp. 5-6</em>.</p>

<p>A question posed by a white woman, &quot;Can the African American community forgive
European Americans?&quot;, brought a lot of emotions at first and then a conclusion that
the question was irrelevant in the mind of Wanda Lofton. She believes that African
Americans have created a culture of systematic forgiveness. The isolated incidents of
racial hatred usually get a lot of media coverage, but exaggerate the role hatred plays
among African Americans. According to Peter J. Paris (Wanda Lofton provides a quote from
his book &quot;The Spirituality of African People&quot;), African people were able to
overcome resentment and hatred toward Europeans because of their value of community.
Building community implies forgiveness becoming an important part of people's lives. The
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. put forgiveness and reconciliation at the core of his
ideology of civil rights movement. This was not a struggle against white people, but a
struggle for a better future for both races, for the values of democracy and shared
community. Wanda Lofton hopes that while asking for forgiveness, white people will engage
in systematic repentance. African Americans, by granting systematic forgiveness to
European Americans, came close to reconciliation. For reconciliation to happen, European
Americans should be able &quot;to challenge themselves to repentance&quot; (p. 6). </p>
