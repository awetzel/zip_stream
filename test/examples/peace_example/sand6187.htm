<p>In 1979 Sandinista Interior minister Thomas Borge released over 5000 imprisoned
national guardsmen. He extended personal forgiveness to two of the guardsmen who had

released guardsmen promptly fled to Honduras and joined the anti-Sandinista forces there.
In this case forgiveness failed to produce reconciliation.</p>
