<h1>Mediation: A Gang Prevention Strategy</h1>

<p>Mendelsohn, David Oliver. &quot;Mediation: A Gang Prevention Strategy.&quot; MCS
Conciliation Quarterly. Winter 1991. Vol. 10, No. 1. Pp. 5-6. </p>

<p>This article talks about mediation between two gang groups. The groups &quot;were not
hard-core business gangs,&quot; but &quot;groups...in the early gang formation
stages&quot; (p. 5). Communication between them was hampered by cultural and gender
differences; they were divided racially and one group had female participants, while the
other was male dominated. They still lacked distinct leadership. The escalation of the
conflict between the two groups reached a high level of violence: four people were stabbed
and several beaten. Thus, mediation happened at the stage of gang formation based on the
members' need to protect themselves against another group.</p>

<p>At the mediation sessions, gang members discussed the issues of their disagreement,
which were surprisingly very similar for both of the groups. The fact that the mediator
was not a police officer supported the confidentiality of the process and its voluntary
nature, as well as parties' responsibility for resolving their conflict, and created a
trustful and enthusiastic atmosphere among the participants. Gender and cultural
differences were causing communication problems; the male dominated group resisted
initially to the presence of young women on the other side and the fact that they had a
female spokesperson. Despite those differences, an agreement was reached and was upheld
for over a year, up until the time the article was written. The mediation in this case
played two important functions: it de-escalated the conflict and hampered the formation of
two gang groups. Thus, it became a preventive measure. </p>
