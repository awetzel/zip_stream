<p>The American administration and its allies used a powerful metaphor to win public
support for their use of force in the Gulf conflict of 1991. &quot;Villain attacks
powerless victim and then the hero comes to defeat the villain and rescue the victim.
Villain is not a rational human being, he does not respond to persuasion or rational
reasoning, thus the only way of dealing with him is through his defeat.&quot; Saddam
Hussein was presented as a villain. The US, leading the coalition forces, was a hero and
Kuwait was the victim. This perception prevented any attempts for a negotiated solution of
the conflict. Stereotyping and demonization did not allow for the arguments made by such
people as Roger Fisher (co-author of a famous book on negotiation, &quot;Getting to
Yes&quot;) to be taken into consideration. The historic example of Hitler's appeasement
before the World War II was used to prove the uselessness of negotiation. Paul Wahrhaftig
concludes this article with a call for creating alternate metaphors that support peaceful
resolution of conflicts. </p>
