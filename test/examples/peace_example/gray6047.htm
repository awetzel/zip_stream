Problems, (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1989), pp. 16-25. </p>

<p>In March 1979 there was an accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. The
accident released a significant, but not serious, amount of radioactivity into the
atmosphere. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) determined that the released radiation
did not pose a public health threat. However, neither the NRC nor Metropolitan Edison
(which operated the reactor) was able to convey that conclusion in a credible and
understandable manner. Public suspicion of the NRC and MetEd and fear of possible
radiation exposure grew. </p>

<p>In order to assess the damage to the reactor, and begin cleanup, MetEd recommended the
further release of low levels of radioactive gas. The NRC had determined that such further
release did not pose a health hazard. However, public opposition to further release of
radiation was intense. First, NRC information focused on rational, technical arguments
which did not address the citizens' personal health concerns. Second, public officials
tended to dismiss the citizen's emotional concerns which further reduced the citizen's
trust in those officials. Third, citizen's unfamiliarity with radiation, and their
distrust of the government's information, amplified their fears.</p>

<p>In order to provide the citizenry with accurate information on the radiation health
risks, and to rebuild trust and credibility, the DOE initiated the Citizens' Radiation
Monitoring Program. Under this program lay-citizens were chosen by their communities to
monitor radiation levels in the community. Monitors were given intensive training in
measuring and interpreting results. Communities chose their own monitoring schedules and
locations. Citizens had more confidence in the data collected by fellow community members.
Involving the citizenry directly increased public trust of the government agencies. In
turn, this improved understanding of the situation and increased trust in the involved
agencies resulted in more productive dialogues.</p>
