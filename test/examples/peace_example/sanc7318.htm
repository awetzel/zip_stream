311-318.</em></p>

<p>McIntosh examines the use and effectiveness of United Nations sanctions in five cases.
Drawing on these cases, he suggests three factors which influence the effectiveness of
sanctions.</p>

<p>The UN first employed sanctions against Rhodesia in 1966. Few nations took steps to
enforce the sanctions, and South Africa actively opposed them. It wasn't until the U.S.
and South Africa began to apply pressure that the warring factions were moved to
negotiations. In the late 1970s the West initiated an arms embargo and serious economic
sanctions against South Africa, in an attempt to end the practice of racial apartheid. The
South African economy depended on commodity trading and foreign capital. Sanctions caused
an economic crisis, which prompted the government to negotiate an end to minority rule in
the early 1990s. Domestic opposition, cultural changes, and the end of the Cold War
facilitated the government's decision to negotiate.</p>

<p>Sanctions were leveled against Iraq due to its invasion of Kuwait. Sanctions remain in
force because Iraq has not complied with UN orders regarding weapons destruction and the
return of Kuwaiti property. To date, sanctions against Iraq have not been effective. The
ruling elite has managed to shift the effects of sanctions onto the domestic opposition,
and have not themselves felt the shortages. Some members of the ruling elite have actually
profited. Neighboring Arab states have not enforced sanctions strongly. Iraq has been able
to maintain the infrastructure despite sanctions and has rich farmlands. Moreover, the
Iraqi leadership feels that capitulating to the sanctions threatens their existence and
credibility as a nation.</p>

<p>The UN has leveled air, arms and diplomatic sanctions against Libya to encourage Libyan
cooperation in international investigations into terrorist activities. These relatively
mild sanctions have not been effective.</p>

<p>A blanket arms embargo on Yugoslavia gave Serbs a military advantage over the Bosnian
Muslims. While sanctions have had a devastating economic effect on the populace, the
ruling parties have not been as deeply affected. Some members of the ruling elite have
profited from the black-market. In addition sanctions seem to have intensified Serbian
nationalism. The overall effect of sanctions in the former Yugoslavia remains difficult to
assess.</p>

<p>Oil and arms embargoes on Haiti produced rapid results. Sanctions were put in place in
June 1993 to encourage restoration of a democratic government. The democratically elected
president was reinstalled in August 1993 and sanctions were lifted.</p>

<p>McIntosh concludes that &quot;although comprehensive economic sanctions may not, in the
short term at least, compel target states to alter their behavior, they adversely affect
the ability of those states to continue that behavior.&quot;[p. 317] Broad, vigorously
enforced sanctions are the most effective. </p>

<p>Sanctions are less effective on autocratic governments than on democratic ones. In
autocratic states the ruling elite can often avoid or even profit from shortages, and can
more easily ignore the suffering of the general population. Use of sanctions can
strengthen existing nationalist resolve in the target country. McIntosh also notes that
sanctions can have serious impact on third-party states. Developing better mechanisms for
compensation of affected third- parties would likely improve their enforcement of and
compliance with sanctions. </p>
