<h1>The Consequences of Agreements</h1>

<h2>Louis Kriesberg</h2>

<hr>

<p>Kriesberg, Louis, &quot;The Consequences of Agreements,&quot; chap. in International
Conflict Resolution, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992) pp. 156-178.</p>

<p>Kriesberg draws on Egyptian-Israeli and on U.S.-Soviet relations to illustrate the
various consequences of de-escalation agreements. He examines consequences in six general
areas: implementation of de-escalation agreements, views of the adversary, military
spending, trade and other exchanges between the adversaries, conflictive and cooperative
behaviors, and domestic policies.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>Generally, formal de-escalation agreements have been implemented. Negotiations at Camp
David produced a successful and enduring peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. On the
matter of the Palestinians and disputed territories the Camp David Accords did result in
further negotiations. However those further negotiations broke down without producing an
agreement.</p>

<p>While U.S.-Soviet agreements have not been repudiated, the degree of implementation has
varied. Arms control agreements have been implemented and basically adhered to. This is
because arms control agreements rest on the acknowledgment of military parity between the
U.S. and the USSR, a status the USSR was eager to have recognized. However, in 1986 the
U.S. declared that it would not abide by the SALT II agreement. The 1972 Basic Principles
Agreement, while not repudiated, was never implemented.</p>

<h3>Views of the Adversary</h3>

<p>Surveys found that Israelis had a relatively high opinion of Arab interest in peace
during the separation of forces negotiations after the October 1973 war. Opinion dropped
somewhat after the agreement was signed, with 20 to 35 percent of Israeli citizens
agreeing that Arab nations were ready to discuss real peace with Israel. Israeli public
opinion rose sharply when Sadat made his historic visit to Jerusalem, but again dropped
somewhat after the Israel-Egypt peace treaty was completed. The U.S. public showed strong
disapproval of the USSR in the early 1950s. That antagonism decreased steadily through the
1960s and by the early 1970s American public opinion had warmed sharply. This improving
view occurred as the U.S. and the Soviets reached de-escalation agreements (in 1955, and
1963) and the Soviet Union began its campaign for peaceful coexistence. U.S. public
opinion of the USSR worsened during the early 1980s. Kriesberg attributed this downturn to
disillusionment after détente, the rise of political conservatism in the U.S., and
opposition to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>

<h3>Military Expenditures</h3>

<p>Egypt's military spending dropped sharply after the peace treaty with Israel. Israel's
military spending decreased only slightly, however, as Israel still faced threats from
other Arab nations. </p>

<p>Soviet military spending increased steadily through the 1960s and 1970s. Spending
increased despite arms control agreements and détente. However, military spending was a
very significant element of the Soviet domestic economy. Spending decreased in the
mid-1980s, as Gorbachev's administration embarked on a program of glasnost. U.S. military
spending has also been heavily influenced by domestic concerns, and by other conflicts.
Spending increased for the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The drop in U.S. military spending
after the Vietnam War may have been further facilitated by détente. Military spending
also tends to increase slightly before presidential elections.</p>

<h3>Trade</h3>

<p>Initially, trade between Israel and Egypt and the other Arab nation was virtually non-
existent. The Egypt-Israel peace treaty was followed by increasing trade between the
nations, though Egyptian trade dropped off after Israel invaded Lebanon. Many Israelis
visited Egypt as tourists. Relatively few Egyptian tourists visit Israel, however, and
Israel takes this to indicate that the peace with Egypt is a cold one. Since there is less
U.S. demand for Soviet goods than there is Soviet demand for American goods, overall
Soviet export rates are lower than American export rates at any given time. Taking this
basic asymmetry into account, Kriesberg examines the fluctuations in the rates of export.
Soviet exports to the U.S. were low through the 1960s, but increased sharply in the early
stages of détente. Exports to the U.S. dropped following the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, but rose again in the late 1980s. Similarly, American exports to the USSR
were low through the 1960s, although grain exports increased after the 1963 grain
agreement. Exports to the USSR increased during détente, and increased through the 1970s.
American exports dropped after the invasion of Afghanistan, but only to their 1974 levels.</p>

<p>Cultural and scientific exchanges between the U.S. and USSR increased steadily
throughout the Cold War period. The official exchanges of academic personnel declined
somewhat during the tensions of the early 1980s. However private and unofficial exchanges
continued and even increased during this period.</p>

<h3>Conflictive and Cooperative Behaviors</h3>

<p>The complex and interconnected nature of Middle East conflicts makes it difficult to
isolate the behavioral consequences of any one de-escalation agreement. Initially, as with
trade, cooperative behavior between Israel and Egypt and the other Arab nation was
virtually non- existent. Low levels of cooperation between Israel and Egypt began after
their 1973 disengagement agreement. Cooperation increased after the peace treaty in 1979.
However, conflictive behaviors continued even as cooperative behaviors increased, due in
part to continued Egypt-Israeli conflict over the Palestinians.</p>

<p>U.S. and Soviet behaviors have generally paralleled each other. Cooperative behavior
tended to increase with de-escalation negotiations and agreements. Cooperation peaked
during détente in the early 1970s. Conflictive behaviors, often by carried out by allies
and proxies, increased as détente broke down and both superpowers competed for influence
in the Third World.</p>

<h3>Domestic Policies</h3>

<p>Israeli policies which grant automatic citizenship to immigrant Jews, and policies
which deny the right of Palestinians to return to territory evacuated during the war,
remain in place despite strong Arab opposition. Egyptian education and media portrayals
regarding Israel have improved some since their peace treaty.</p>

<p>Contrary to the popular opinion of the time, the USSR has not been inclined to demand
changes in American domestic policies. The U.S. however has pressured the Soviet Union to
change its domestic policies regarding human rights, emigration, and democratization. The
right of Soviet Jews to emigrate was a major issue of contention during the late 1970s and
early 1980s.</p>
