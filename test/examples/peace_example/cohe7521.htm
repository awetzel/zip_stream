<h2>U.S.-China Miscommunication</h2>

<p>Raymond Cohen</p>

<hr>

<p>Selection from: Raymond Cohen, Negotiating Across Cultures: Communication Obstacles in
International Diplomacy, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1991),
pp. 126.</p>

<p>Cultural differences can sometimes mean that signals are missed, which can cause delays
and missed opportunities. For example, many such signals were missed by American diplomats
in the early days of U.S.-China reconciliation. Cohen points out that &quot;U.S. observers
entirely missed the most significant Chinese signal of reconciliation of all in the
1970-71 period.&quot; In October 1970 Chairman Mao invited an American author and
journalist to stand next to him atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace. While this gesture seems
obscure to American diplomats, and hence they did not respond to it, the symbolism was
clear to the Chinese, who expected a significant response.</p>
