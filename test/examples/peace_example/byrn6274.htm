<h1>Northern Ireland: Local Dispute or International Conflict?</h1>

<p>Recent PARC Working Papers: Sean Byrne &quot;Northern Ireland: Local Dispute or
International Conflict?&quot; Working Paper No. 28, July 1993. PARC News. Fall 1993. pp.
4-5.</p>

<p>In this paper, the conflict in Northern Ireland is viewed as an international problem,
rather than an internal (Ireland) problem. The author argues for the necessity of framing
the issues in conflict as not necessarily internal, but determined by the international
situation. This can promote more practical involvement of other countries in the conflict,
which could be beneficial for its resolution. </p>
