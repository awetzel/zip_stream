<h1>Sustaining Peace in Angola</h1>

<hr>
<em>

<p>&quot;Sustaining Peace in Angola,&quot; in PeaceWatch, vol. II, no. 3 (April 1996) p.
5.</em></p>

<p>PeaceWatch reports on David Smock and John Prendergast's visit to Angola. These
scholars examined possible roles for NGOs in that country's ongoing peace process, and the
difficulties that NGOs face in Angola. Smock notes that &quot;typically, practitioners,
scholars, and parties to a conflict give little attention to mending broken relationships
and rebuilding societies.&quot;[p. 5] However, this sort of reconciliation is crucial to
the successful implementation of high-level peace agreements. NGOs can play a valuable
role in the reconciliation process by supporting training and development programs, by
offering training and education in mediation, by training journalists and by providing
policy analysis to insure that new governmental policies continue to promote
reconciliation. NGOs should attempt local, joint programs which bring together individuals
form the opposing sides. They could also use the media to promote peace. These sorts of
NGO activities are hindered in Angola. The Angolan economy and civil society have been
largely destroyed, and the nation is divided into opposing territories. Free movement
between the territories is prohibited. Freedom of expression and assembly are also
restricted. For these reasons, international NGOs operating in Angola have confined their
activities to one side's territory. Smock and Prendergast point out that freedom of
movement, assembly and expression must be re-established in order for NGO's to more
effectively promote reconciliation and rebuild Angolan civil society.</p>
