April 1991. P. 31.</em> </p>

<p>Paul Wahrhaftig finds a lot of similarities between the way the conflict with &quot;the
counter-culture group, MOVE&quot; in 1985 and the Gulf conflict in 1991 were handled (p.
31). In both (1) there was imbalance of power between the parties; (2) the stronger party
demanded the weaker to surrender without negotiating the issues brought up by the weaker
party; (3) each party demonized opponent's leader; negotiations with a &quot;madman&quot;
or &quot;Satan&quot; being impossible. As a result, negotiated solutions were abandoned
and force became the only apparent alternative. </p>
