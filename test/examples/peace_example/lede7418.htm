<p><em>John Paul Lederach, &quot;Process: The Dynamics and Progression of Conflict,&quot;
chap. in Building Peace, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace, 1997), pp.
63-72.</em></p>

<h3>&nbsp;Conflict as Progression</h3>

<p>Lederach adopts mediator Adam Curle's matrix for describing the progress of conflicts
in terms of the balance of power between the parties, and the degree to which the parties
are aware of their conflicting needs and interests. Conflicts progress from situations of
unbalanced power and low awareness, or latent conflict to situations of unbalanced power
and increasing awareness, or overt conflict. Negotiations attempt to bring overt conflicts
to a situation of balanced power and high awareness. When this situation is stable, Curle
calls it peace. Conflicts do not always follow this progression in a linear fashion.
Conflicts may regress, or may occasionally skip stages. The appropriate response to latent
conflict is education to increase awareness of power imbalances and unequal relationships.
Overt conflicts call for confrontation. Advocates work to bring the weaker party's needs
to the attention of the stronger. Confrontation can range from violent to nonviolent. As
awareness of the conflict and recognition of the parties increases the appropriate
response becomes negotiation. Mediators or other facilitators seek to balance power
between the parties. Successful negotiations produce structural changes in the parties'
relationship.</p>

<h3>The Peace building Process</h3>

<p>Excessive emphasis on the personality of the mediator misunderstands the Peace building
process. Lederach describes Peace building as a process which involves a wide variety of
roles and activities, the goal of which is to &quot;create and sustain transformation and
the movement toward restructured relationships.&quot;[p. 71] Peacemaking roles and
activities include educator, advocate, conciliator, trainer, envisioner, mediator,
guarantor, observer, enforcer, rehabilitator and developer. Peace building draws on many
of these activities and applies them at various stages and levels of conflict. </p>

<p>Lederach emphasizes three basic points from this approach. Understanding both conflicts
and Peace building as processes reminds us that peace is not achieved simply by reaching a
cease-fire agreement. To better understand the overall Peace building process, Peace
building activities should be mapped onto the model of conflict. Finally, matching Peace
building activities to points within the general conflict model will help us to better
understand how each of those activities contributes to the larger goal of peace.</p>
