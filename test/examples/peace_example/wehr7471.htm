<p>Upheaval conflict is what human societies fear most. Internal political revolution is
one example. A fault line runs across a society such as Guatemala, with a few having much
and most having little in the way of life chances. When conditions are right, a movement
develops that produces a deep cleavage of society, with massive and uncontrolled conflict
and temporary disintegration. Usually, successful revolutions go sour after a bit as new
tyrants and classes displace the old. Even where the conflict is less extreme, it can be
very costly for all involved. For each society, then, the problem is how to insure that
single, deep divisions do not develop. If they already exist, what devices, institutions,
ways of doing conflict can be put in place to permit less extreme, more controlled
conflict so that change happens more gradually but is sufficiently responsive to aggrieved
groups to maintain social integration. </p>
