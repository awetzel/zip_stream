<p>John Applegate and Douglas Sarno, &quot;Coping with Complex Facts and Multiple Parties
in Public Disputes,&quot; Consensus, No. 31 (July 1996) p. 1, 12.</em></p>

<p>The authors describe the educational tools used to assist a citizens task force in
developing clean-up recommendations for a closed nuclear weapons facility. Applegate and
Sarno participated in the task force as chair and technical consultant, respectively.</p>

<h3>Parties and Issues</h3>

<p>In 1993 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began clean-up proceeding at a
decommissioned nuclear weapons facility near Fernald, Ohio. In accordance with revised DOE
policy, a representative board of citizens was formed to advise the government officials
responsible for the clean-up. The Fernald Citizens Task Force included site neighbors,
environmentalists, labor and business representatives, academics and public health
officials. The task force needed to decide what future uses would be safe for the site,
and whether contamination of the underlying aquifer could be avoided. The task force
produced a thorough and detailed set of recommendations within two years. Their
recommended clean-up was less expensive and quicker than initial estimates had suggested.
Their recommendations were accepted by the DOE. </p>

<p>The authors argue that &quot;the most important factor in the Task Force's success was
the education process by which its members, whose knowledge of the site ranged from
minimal to comprehensive, came to understand the details of the problems and the options
realistically available.&quot;[p.1] Radioactive waste from Fernald would have to be
disposed of either on-site or off-site. As is typical, the task force was first inclined
to dispose of all the waste elsewhere. This is the NIMBY or &quot;not in my backyard&quot;
approach. Over the course of deliberations, the Task Force came to realize that complete
off-site disposal was likely to be politically, technically and financially very
difficult. Using the educational tools developed by the authors, the Task Force was able
to come up with a balanced approach which included both off-site and on-site disposal.
Their balanced approach was ultimately safer, faster and less expensive than their
original NIMBY position.</p>

<h3>Educational Tools</h3>

<p>The authors developed two tools which enabled them to present the overwhelming amount
of technical information involved in the Fernald case in a clear, understandable way. They
named their main tool the &quot;Tool Box.&quot; Their goal was to condense the vast amount
of information into one binder. They started the binder with just a few pages of basic
background information. As subsequent meetings brought up further issues, that information
was added to the binder in distilled, often graphical form. The authors attempted to
present each issue &quot;on a single sheet of paper that compared costs, benefits, and
other consequences of alternative decisions.&quot;[p.12] Extensive use of color charts,
graphs and maps helped to present large volumes of information in an easily understood
form. Maps were scaled to allow direct comparisons.</p>

<p>While the Tool Box allowed members to understand the issues, the authors found that
&quot;it was often difficult for members to see many variables simultaneously: costs,
on-site and off-site disposal requirements, impacts of construction, level of
contamination, risk levels, and land use, to name but a few.&quot;[p. 12] To provide a
clearer understanding of the interactions among such variables, Applegate and Sarno
developed a dynamic model, a game they called &quot;FutureSite.&quot; The
&quot;gameboard&quot; consisted of a map of the site, broken up into a regular grid. On
each square were placed color coded chips, which indicated the amount and degree of
contamination at that location. The &quot;rules&quot; of the game were set by worksheets
listing the costs of disposal options, the acres of space needed for on-site disposal, and
the numbers of truckloads for off-site disposal. Task Force members manipulated the model
to evaluate the various clean-up options. The model, in turn, illustrated very clearly the
costs, benefits and tradeoffs involved in the various options. FutureSite was also used by
DOE official and the site contractor, and so provided the various parties with a common
frame of reference. Based on their experience with the Fernald Citizens Task Force, the
authors believe that the public is capable of making &quot;fair, efficient, wise and
stable&quot; decisions in complex cases. Education is the key to producing good decisions.
And the authors argue that the key to education is recognizing that &quot;information must
be in the right format to be comprehensible.&quot;[p.12]</p>
