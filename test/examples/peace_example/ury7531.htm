<p><em>William Ury and Richard Smoke, &quot;Anatomy of a Crisis,&quot; in Negotiation
Theory and Practice, eds. J. William Breslin and Jeffery Z. Rubin, (Cambridge: The Program
on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, 1991), pp.47-54.</em></p>

<p>Ury and Smoke describe the basic elements of a crisis. They explore crisis escalation,
and ways to defuse crises. </p>

<p><strong>Structure of a Crisis</strong></p>

<p>Crisis situations share four basic elements. First, in a crisis the stakes are high. In
many cases a party unintentionally raises the stakes to crisis levels by their failure to
appreciate the broader consequences of their actions. Stakes may also increase rapidly
through the process of mutual reinforcement of hostile expectations. Each party's
defensive actions are perceived as offensive, prompting further defensive actions and
starting a vicious spiral of escalation. The second element of a crisis situation is that
there is little time available to deliberate. Ultimatums can provoke crisis situations. </p>

<p>Third, crises are also characterized by great uncertainty. Parties may lack information
about the situation and the other actors. They may me uncertain of the other sides'
motives and intentions. And parties are usually uncertain as to the effects that
particular actions will have within the crisis context and the ways in which the situation
might escalate. Fourth, crises involve a sense of narrowed options. Options may become
polarized and extreme. Creative or moderate options are lacking. Sometimes parties
purposefully narrow options by making irrevocable commitments. Such shows of commitment
are intended to make the other side back down, but can escalate situations when the other
side uses a similar strategy. </p>

<p><strong>Crisis Escalation</strong></p>

<p>As a crisis intensifies, each of these elements also intensifies. Time runs out. The
stakes go up and this increases uncertainty. Options become further polarized in the face
of increasing uncertainty and not enough time to deliberate effectively. These factors
also contribute to a growing sense of hostility. &quot;Short time, the uncertainties, the
difficult value tradeoffs, and the sense of constricting possibilities exacerbate the
hostility felt and expected.&quot;[p. 52]</p>

<p>Some crises are unintentional. However, many are the result of intentional pursuit of
other interests. Where interests are important, people are often willing to risk
precipitating a crisis. Unfortunately, even crises that are anticipated or foreseen have
the potential to escalate out of control, as the distinctive elements of a crisis
situation come into play.</p>

<p><strong>Defusing Crises</strong></p>

<p>The key to defusing a crisis is to enable high-quality decision-making. Enabling better
decision-making during a crisis requires control of the four basic crisis elements. First,
the parties must seek to control the perceived stakes. Second, they must slow the rate of
action and reaction to allow sufficient time for the sides to consult with each other, and
to deliberate. Third, accurate and trustworthy information must be made available about
the other side's intentions and the situation. Fourth, the parties must remain flexible
and generate a range of options.</p>
