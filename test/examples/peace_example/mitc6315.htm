Conflict Resolution in the Middle East.&quot; ICAR Newsletter. Fall 1993, V. 5, No. 6. Pp.

<p>The Oslo Process was a major success and a classic example of Track Two diplomacy,
including all major components of the theory. It was a long-term process with adequate
time spent on building trust between all the parties involved in negotiations. It was not
public and maintained a high level of confidentiality. The third party facilitation was
performed by a neutral mediator, Norway, which did not have any self-interests in the
conflict and was not powerful enough to impose its decisions on the parties. What was
different about this case was that the process took place simultaneously with official
negotiations which started in Spain and later moved to the USA, as opposed to the widely
supported notion of Track Two diplomacy preceding the official negotiations. </p>

<p>Mitchell believes that the Oslo Process is not a unique example of success of Track Two
diplomacy and that there were other attempts made in the Arab-Israeli as well as the
Israeli-Palestinian conflicts which deserve recognition. He names a few of them. Since
1949 Quakers were facilitating communication between Arabs and Israelis by mediating and
organizing conferences and meetings. Similar activities were undertaken by foreign and
local scholars. Since the 1970s, Herbert Kelman of Harvard has been working on bringing
Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiation table by conducting problem-solving
workshops. Some of those who participated in these workshops were later involved in the
Madrid negotiations. Other examples constitute what has been called &quot;citizen
diplomacy&quot;. In 1988, an American Jewish group from the Center for Peace in the Middle
East headed by Rita Hauser &quot;extracted from&quot; Yasir Arafat a statement in which he
recognized the state of Israel and &quot;a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict&quot; and condemned terrorism (p. 8). </p>

<p>Mitchell emphasizes the need to examine those not so &quot;successful&quot; cases as
well as the definite success of the Oslo Process and come up with better theories on the
time of &quot;ripeness&quot; of conflict for resolution and the types of intervention
strategies appropriate for different conflict conditions. Thus the Oslo negotiations
provide hope for transformation of the Middle East conflict toward resolution and
represent a valuable case for analysis of peace-making processes. </p>
