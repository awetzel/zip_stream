<h1><strong>John Forester -- Citizen Involvement in Transportation Planning</strong></h1>

<p>Lawence Susskind chaired the regional Citizen Advisory Committee considering a proposed
extension of the Boston subway system. While the Committee was successful in reaching a
consensus recommendation, their proposal was overruled by the state. Susskind felt that
the Committee's main goal needed to be reaching a consensus recommendation. Without
consensus, any settlement was likely to unravel due to later political infighting. </p>

<p>Susskind found that when the various options were discussed abstractly there was a lot
of disagreement. But when options were presented in fairly concrete images, agreement came
much more easily. Initially the engineers called for a ten thousand car parking garage at
the site. Citizen groups opposed any parking. When the Committee reviewed slides of actual
parking garages of various sizes, the engineers realized that their plan was unrealistic
and the citizens' position softened. The Committee succeeded in developing a win-win
option, supported by everyone on the Committee. Susskind notes that &quot;the option
included a set of trade-offs that no one had envisioned in the first place, which was, you
could improve the environment in exchange for allowing this development to go
ahead.&quot;[p. 319]</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Committee had only advisory power. The state chose to implement an
option without the environmental compensations. When the Committee challenged the state,
they were dismissed and the task force dissolved. This angered the members of the
Committee, who had agreed not to block the subway extension in exchange for a voice in the
planning process. However, the state's decision stood and the subway extension was built
without environmental protections and without court challenge.</p>
