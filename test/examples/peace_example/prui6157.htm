<p>Selection [on irrevocable comments in Social Conflict] from: Dean Pruitt and Jeffrey
Rubin, Social Conflict: Escalation, Stalemate and Settlement, (New York: Random House,
1986), pp. 57-8.</em></p>

<p>The authors discuss the use of irrevocable commitments in nonviolent resistance. For
example, by announcing his irrevocable commitment to fast until certain British policies
were changed, Gandhi effectively shifted responsibility for the conflict's course onto the
British. Once Gandhi's commitment was made, whether he lived or died would depend solely
on Britain's actions. The authors observe that &quot;on virtually every occasion in which
nonviolence was tried in India...the tactic worked as intended.&quot;[p. 58]</p>

<p>Although Gandhi's use of irrevocable commitments was nonviolent, such tactics are still
contentious, designed to result in unacceptable consequences unless the opponent takes
ameliorative action. Irrevocable commitments differ from threats. Threats propose some
future action (reward or punishment) in response to the opponent's actions. An irrevocable
commitment undertakes some course of action, to which the opponent must then respond.</p>
