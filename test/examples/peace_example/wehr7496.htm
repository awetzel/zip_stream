<p>There is a well-known historical illustration of such methods of controlling
confrontation, Gandhian nonviolence. Wehr (1979) has termed Gandhi's approach to conflict
as a self-limiting one. Gandhi was challenging a number of political and social conditions
in British India, most notably colonial rule, caste and religious discrimination, and
exploitation of workers and peasants. He had to confront these &quot;opponents&quot; but
he had to do so without unleashing the enormous potential for violent upheaval existing in
the India of that time. His moral and political philosophies found practical form in
methods he used to inhibit runaway responses. To prevent proliferation of issues, for
example, Gandhi was careful to focus each satyagraha campaign on a single, clear issue
around which agreement might be reached. This helped to keep the conflict within bounds.
His practice of maintaining good personal relations with his opponents during a campaign
prevented the shift from disagreement over an issue to personal antagonism. His policy of
complete openness in both interpersonal and media communication reduced the threat and
suspicion that secrecy and unpredictability introduce into a conflict. His total
commitment to nonviolence tended to insure that response reinforcement would operate to
encourage a cooperative solution rather than a competitive power contest. Finally,
Gandhi's training and retraining of his satyagraha leaders in nonviolent discipline
reduced the possibility of extremist elements gaining entrance to the movement.&nbsp;
Gandhi saw his opponents as partners in a search for a fair and truthful resolution of a
struggle rather than an enemy to be humbled or destroyed. Bondurant (1988) has called this
approach the &quot;Gandhian dialectic.&quot; Satyagraha was a dialectical process where
nonviolent action (antithesis) engages existing structures of power (thesis) in a
truth-seeking struggle leading to a more just and truthful relationship (synthesis).
Nonviolence is the confrontation-controlling device. Stepwise escalation, by providing
intervals of reflection and withdrawal between escalating steps, ensures that opponents
may suspend confrontation or loop back to negotiation (Ury et al 1993), returning from
more intense power methods to an earlier, more cooperative stage. </p>
