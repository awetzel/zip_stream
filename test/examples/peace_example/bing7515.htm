<p>U.S. Agency for International Development, Bureau for Asia and the Near
East,&quot;Resolving Water Disputes: Conflict and Cooperation in the United States, the
Near East and Asia,&quot; by Gail Bingham, Aaron Wolf, and Tom Wohlgenant. Applied Study,
Irrigation Support Project for Asia and the Near East, November 1994.</p>

<p>The authors describe the special problems that water disputes pose for negotiated
resolution. They then describe the negotiation stages and strategies used to resolve such
complex disputes.</p>

<p>Characteristics of Water Disputes</p>

<p>Water disputes pose particular challenges for negotiation. Stakeholders may disagree on
the nature of the dispute, on which issues are central, on who should be involved in
negotiations, on how negotiations should be conducted, and even on whether negotiations
are the best means of resolving the dispute. Many of these difficulties arise from the
very nature of water disputes. Because water flows across legal and political boundaries,
the number of potential stakeholders in a water dispute is increased. This
boundary-crossing also means that various stakeholders may feel that they have recourse to
better alternatives to negotiation. The stakeholders in water disputes are often
organizations or institutions. These groups' internal bureaucracies can further complicate
the dispute. </p>

<p>In addition, water resource management is inherently technically complex and subject to
much scientific uncertainty. This uncertainty and complexity can increase disagreement on
the nature of the issues, and on which issues are central. Power differences between the
stakeholders can also pose challenges for effective negotiations. Usually the party with
the most power has the most say in crafting the resolution. In the long run, however,
ignoring the needs of the weaker parties will destabilize any agreement, as the weaker
parties will continue to agitate for more favorable conditions. </p>

<p>Negotiation Strategies</p>

<p>Negotiation success can be measured in different ways. Focusing on substance,
negotiations may be called successful when they produce a mutually beneficial agreement at
lower cost that an alternative forum, and when that agreement is implemented. Focusing on
process, a successful negotiation would be one which was fair, efficient in terms of time
and money, involved in all the relevant stakeholders, consistent with applicable
regulations, and did not establish limiting precedents for third-parties. Focusing on
relations, successful negotiations are those in which the parties maintain civil relations
of mutual recognition and respect, and improve their joint problem-solving abilities.
Generally the substantive measure tends to dominate.</p>

<p>One key negotiating strategy is to focus on interests rather than positions. A party's
interests are the reasons they have for holding a particular position on an issue.
Negotiations based on positions tend to devolve into contests of will. They are less
successful by any measure. Incompatible positions may be backed by compatible interests,
and so negotiating on interests is more likely to produce fair, mutually beneficial
outcomes without generating added hostility. In addition to separating interests from
positions, it is helpful to generate a wide range of possible solutions before trying to
come to a decision. It is also helpful for the parties to agree on the criteria by which
possible solutions will be evaluated before actually setting down to evaluate the
proposals.</p>

<p>Negotiating strategies may be integrative (win-win) or distributional (zero-sum).
Negotiating on interests is often integrative. The goal is to make the parties' interests
compatible, so that both sides can &quot;win,&quot; that is, reach an agreement that
satisfies their needs. While integrative negotiation strategies are preferable, they are
not always possible. Sometimes parties' interests really are opposed, as when both sides
want a larger share of a fixed resource. In these cases distributional negotiations, which
seek to distribute the costs and benefits fairly, are necessary. Water dispute often have
zero-sum elements. Sometimes disputes which appear to be zero-sum can be reframed so that
an integrative approach is possible. One way to do this is to find creative ways to
increase or use the apparently &quot;fixed&quot; resource. Another way is to reinterpret
the parties' interests to make them compatible, or to find more basic interests which are
compatible. </p>

<p>Negotiation Stages</p>

<p>The overall negotiation process is made up of three general phases: pre-negotiation,
negotiation, and implementation. While parties often focus on the negotiation phase, the
pre- negotiation and implementation phases are as important. Negotiations are proposed and
organized in the pre-negotiation phase. In water disputes, getting the parties to agree to
negotiate can be difficult. One way to bring people to the table is to show them that
their best alternative to a negotiated agreement (for instance, litigation) is actually
worse than negotiating. Show them that they are more likely to get what they want at lower
cost through negotiations than through any other method. Other factors which contribute to
a successful pre-negotiation phase include having a limited number of stakeholders and of
related issues, of having parties that demonstrate interest in good faith negotiating,
having the resources to conduct negotiations and implement agreements, and having some
reasonable deadline for a solution. Once the parties agree to hold negotiations, they must
then agree on the issues to be discussed, which parties to include, and on the negotiation
procedures to be used.</p>

<p>Once the negotiation phase has begun the parties have four basic tasks to complete.
First, they must confirm or modify the informal agreements on negotiation organization and
procedure made during the pre-negotiation phase. Second, the parties must exchange
information. The parties may need to share technical information. They should explain
their interests and try to identify previously unstated assumptions. Listening is a key
activity at this point. Third, once both sides have an improved understanding of the
issues and interests, they should begin to generate creative options to seek mutually
beneficial outcomes. Separating the invention stage from the evaluation stage helps to
foster creativity and to maintain a cooperative rather than competitive atmosphere.
Finally, the parties must narrow the options and settle on an agreement. Parties generally
do this by identifying the issues on which they have agreement, those issues on which they
were indifferent, and those on which there remained strong disagreement. The group may
then either attempt to reach some agreement on the divisive issues, or may agree to
address the divisive issues in later negotiations. Areas of agreement should be written up
in a draft settlement.</p>

<p>Agreements must be implemented. In the implementation phase the agreement needs to be
ratified by the negotiators' constituency groups. The parties also need to negotiate such
implementation issues as the definition of terms, terms of enforcement, and how unexpected
circumstances will be handled. Agreements may fail to be implemented for a variety of
reasons. The agreement may be impractical or unclear, the parties may act in bad faith,
the constituent groups may not accept the agreement, or new or excluded groups may oppose
the agreement. There are three basic tactics for avoiding implementation problems. The
first and most basic tactic is to anticipate and avoid problems. Make sure that the
proposed agreement is practically feasible, and that all the relevant parties have been
consulted. A second tactic is to create self-enforcing implementation mechanisms.
Self-enforcing agreements generally include rewards for compliance, negative consequences
for violations, and provisions for monitoring compliance. Contingent agreements may give
the parties additional incentives to comply; provisions which create an ongoing
relationship between the parties also help to prevent bad faith violations. The third
tactic is to specify mechanisms for dealing with problems which arise over the course of
the implementation process. For instance, the implementation agreement may specify that
future implementation disputes be submitted to arbitration or mediation.</p>
