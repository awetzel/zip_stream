<p><em>Helen Wolle, &quot;Interpreting Violent Conflict: A Conference for Conflict
Analysts and Journalists: Summary of Proceedings,&quot; George Mason University: Institute
for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, September 1990.</em></p>

<p>Conference participants discussed how frames of interpretation affect media coverage of
conflicts. A frame of interpretation &quot;tells the analyst or reporter what kind of
conflict he or she is observing, which sources of information are relevant, what questions
to ask, and how to interpret the answers.&quot;[p. 2] An inappropriate frame distorts or
limits understanding of the conflict situation.</p>

<p>One participant cited the example of the 1989 uprising in China. The media framed
events as a student uprising. This led the media to expect non-violent protests demanding
Western-style democratic reforms. Reporters missed the violent and revolutionary elements
of the protests, and overlooked the significance of the participation of numerous workers.
This inappropriate frame led journalists to overlook important background to the conflict,
to misinterpret the then-current situation, and to fail to anticipate the violent climax.</p>

<p>Another participant contrasted the predominant U.S. media frame, which reflects
middle-class American attitudes, with a frame which focuses on human needs. The mainstream
frame suggests that non-conforming social groups and elements can be brought into
conformity with the dominant norms by force. This frame has a number of faults. First, it
leads to the under- representation of minorities as reporters seek information from
sources who are like them: educated and middle-class. He charged that &quot;mainstream
journalism and scholarship therefore represents the middle class speaking to
itself.&quot;[p. 4] Second, this narrow focus leads the media to overlook the
system-problems which are the root cause of much social conflict. Shifting to a human
needs frame could remedy these defects. A human needs frame would recognize that conflicts
are the result of unmet needs, and that such conflicts cannot be resolved by force. They
can only be resolved by identifying and addressing the underlying needs. </p>

<p>Just as class-specific frames are distorting, so can culturally biased frames be
distorting. One participant argued that the media tend to interpret events through their
preconceived notions of society and through stereotypes. This then perpetuates those
preconceptions. In particular the media tends to be ignorant about other cultures and
world-views. Instead journalists interpret events through the frame of their own culture.
In this same vein, another participant argued that &quot;the most powerful newspapers and
networks have served as an arm of dominant Great Power interests rather than as a
trustworthy source of information.&quot;[p. 13] Third world nations are increasingly
calling for reorganization of the information industry to better meet their informational
needs. Of course the dominant press is sometimes valued precisely as a source of
information on the interests and attitudes of the great powers. </p>
