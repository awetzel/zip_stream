<p>Brian Urquhart, &quot;Current and Future Arrangements for Intervention,&quot; in
Managing Conflict in the Post-Cold War World: The Role of Intervention. Report of the
Aspen Institute Conference, August 2-6, 1995, (Aspen, Colorado: Aspen Institute, 1996) pp.
97-104.</em></p>

<p>Urquhart describes the intervention dilemma currently facing the international
community. During the Cold War, the principle of respect for national sovereignty limited
U.N. interventions to cases in which international peace and security was threatened. In
the post-Cold War era sovereignty is increasingly thought of as being a property of a
people rather than of a state. Hence, humanitarian interventions to protect the rights of
peoples seems increasingly justified. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the U.N.'s capacity to make effective humanitarian interventions has not
been developed in pace with these conceptual changes. Recent intervention failures have
undermined confidence in the U.N.. While member nations are reconsidering their
participation in humanitarian interventions, public opinion seems likely to continue to
favor humanitarian action. </p>

<h3>The United Nations at Present</h3>

<p>Although prevention is much talked about, it is seldom used. The U.N. Security Council
is ill-equipped to undertake preventative interventions. The Security Council can only
respond to issues formally put before it. U.N. agencies can sometimes mobilize
humanitarian assistance by widely publicizing some human tragedy. However, it is much more
difficult to generate widespread public concern for military or political situations which
merely have the potential to produce humanitarian tragedy.</p>

<p>In addition, the U.N. is now faced primarily with internal conflicts. Traditionally
U.N. operations distinguished clearly between peacekeeping and enforcement. Peacekeeping
forces strove, with the consent of the conflicting parties, to uphold the already agreed
upon settlement. Enforcement operations deployed military troops to put down blatant
aggression. Humanitarian aid was rare, and generally did not involve peacekeeping. These
traditional techniques have proven much less effective when used in internal conflicts.</p>

<p>Urquhart summarizes the U.N.'s current resources and problems. U.N. resources include
strong Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Humanitarian Affairs and a strong
Secretariat. The Security Council is finally free of its Cold War limitations. Various
U.N. agencies have developed considerable humanitarian expertise and the U.N. has amassed
a substantial humanitarian emergency reserve fund. The U.N. has also developed ties with a
number of humanitarian NGOs. Thirty-some countries hold military troops on standby for
U.N. peacekeeping operations. Finally, regional international organizations offer a
currently under-utilized asset.</p>

<p>Current U.N. problems include unclear or unrealistic Security Council mandates,
confusion over the goals and responsibility of the U.N. forces, and confusion between
enforcement and peacekeeping tasks. The U.N. currently lacks adequate capacity for rapid
deployment, lacks adequate infrastructure to support substantial interventions, and has
difficulties with its command structure. Agreements by member nations to provide troops
may prove unreliable due to domestic political factors. Similarly, member nations are
often unwilling to risk harm for their troops or to make sufficiently long-term troop
commitments.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>

<p>Internal conflicts do not respond well to traditional peacekeeping or enforcement
operations. Past attempts to combine peacekeeping with enforcement have proven
unsuccessful and occasionally disastrous. The U.N. must develop new techniques for
operating in the violent circumstances typical of internal conflicts. Producing clearer
Security Council mandates would be a key first step.</p>

<p>Secondly, the U.N. must develop its rapid reaction capabilities. Better early warning
systems must be developed and the international community must become willing to react in
the early stages of a conflict. U.N. reaction forces could take any of a variety of forms,
but some sort of highly trained standing force seems needed. Member nations have proven to
be unreliable as a source of troops. This force must be able to secure specific areas,
provide security for relief operations, provide intelligence to the Security Council,
provide the initial framework for peace negotiations, and stop violence from escalating.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the U.N. must unify and solidify its command and control over peacekeeping
operations. Recent experience has shown divided command to be potentially disastrous.</p>

<p>Next, the U.N. must develop the needed infrastructure to support its operations. It
must improve its capacity for contingency planning, training and logistics, and improve
its command and staff capacities. </p>

<p>In a closely related point, the U.N. needs to develop a reliable source of financing
for its peacekeeping operations. The author reminds us that, while peacekeeping is
expensive, allowing conflicts to get out of control is even more so.</p>

<p>Finally, the U.N. needs to draw on the presently untapped resources presented by
regional organizations. The U.N. Charter reserves a significant role for regional
organizations. The end of Cold War politics should open the way for regional groups to
play larger roles in the international community.</p>
