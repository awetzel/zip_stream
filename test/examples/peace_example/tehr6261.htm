<p>Tehranian, Majid. 1991. &quot;A Peace Zone for Kurdistan?&quot; Peace Perspectives,
5:4, 5</em>.</p>

<p>This article opens with a discussion of the necessity for Peace Zones in Kurdistan,
Palestine, and Lebanon. The author defines a Peace Zone as a political entity whose
sovereignty resides within the framework of the United Nations, an economic entity with a
common market and &quot;peace bonds&quot; with other Peace Zones, and a culturally safe
community that guarantees human rights and safety from violence for residents of the zone.
This plan's goal is to make peace profitable to all sides, using peaceful resolution of
conflict, economic prosperity through the common market arrangement, and ethnic autonomy
and human rights to achieve a positive sum game. The process has been successfully
implemented in the Philippines; other proposed regions for implementation include the
Falkand/Maldive Islands, Palestine, North and South Korea, and Kurdistan. The author feels
Kurdistan &quot;presents the most pressing case,&quot; because none of the current
countries in which the region is located (Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Syria and several countries
of the former Soviet Union) are unwilling to grant independence and autonomy to a newly
proposed Kurdistan. The countries may be willing, though, to recognize the Kurds as an
internal autonomous group, as long as the UN is in charge of security (through the United
Nations Board of Trustees). As a result of this step toward peace, the countries would
most likely gain millions of dollars for regional development.</p>
