<p>Nancy J. Manring, &quot;Dispute System Design and the U.S. Forest System,&quot;
Negotiation Journal, vol. 9, no. 1 (January 1993), pp 13-21. </p>

<p>The elements of an effective dispute resolution system include an evaluation of
existing dispute resolution procedures, skills development, motivation, resources, and an
analysis of the internal and external organizational environments. The Forest Service has
developed procedures for directing disputes into the dispute resolution process, and they
offer dispute resolution training. </p>

<p>In this essay Manring examines the three remaining three elements. She describes how
current organizational changes in the U.S. Forest Service are leading to a more effective
dispute system, and how organizational changes can better motivate workers to use
negotiation. Manring focuses on three particular organizational changes within the Forest
Service: boundary- spanning, education, and reconciling differences.</p>

<p>Boundary-Spanning</p>

<p>Boundary-spanning by an organization refers to &quot;the formal and informal mechanisms
that develop to link with and obtain information from the external environment.&quot;[p.
15] In the case of the Forest Service, boundary-spanning is needed in order for the Forest
Service to understand its sociopolitical situation, and so to accurately assess its BATNA
(best alternative to a negotiated agreement). Current federal law mandates substantial
public involvement in forest planning. Congressional and judicial intervention in forest
management is more common. Understanding this context makes negotiation more attractive.
Negotiation offers the Forest Service an opportunity to contain conflicts at lower levels
within the Service, reduce the risk of judicial or Congressional intervention, and retain
a greater degree of control over decision- making. One obstacle to boundary-spanning by an
organization is the presence of a strong organizational culture or ideology. Such an
ideology can distort members' perception of their situation. Fortunately, the process of
negotiation itself helps to break down insular organizational culture. Direct interaction
with individuals from outside the organization makes members confront differing interests
and concerns, and broadens members' perspectives. Negotiation also presents an opportunity
for the organization to convey its needs and interests.</p>

<p>Education</p>

<p>Manring observes that &quot;sharing of success stories is critical to dispel fears and
generate wider commitment and support from organization members.&quot;[p. 17] The Forest
Service faced strategic limitations on its ability to share knowledge of success stories
within the Service. Negotiation had been very successful, by Forest Service standards.
Negotiations had not resulted in any significant changes from the Service's original
management plans. However, the Freedom of Information Act would have made any internal
communications regarding these successes available to the general public. Manring found
that &quot;senior officials feared that written reports that emphasized how the Forest
Service was winning' (this emphasis being necessary to overcome the reluctance of agency
officials unfamiliar with negotiations) would jeopardize the win-win' image of dispute
resolution and discourage appellants from participating in future negotiations.&quot;[p.
17] Manring suggests that successes may be better shared on an informal, verbal level.
Another difficulty in educating members about the advantages of negotiation is that the
best teacher seems to be experience. Members who have been involved in negotiation often
found it to be a transformative experience. Manring suggests using members who have
experienced negotiated dispute resolution as proponents within the organization. The
Forest Service might also draw on the famous loyalty of its members to the organization's
interests. The Forest Service leadership should stress that negotiating appeals is an
effective way of retaining the agency's jurisdiction and decision-making power over forest
management issues. </p>

<p>Reconciling Differences</p>

<p>The costs and benefits of negotiation may differ between individuals within the
organization, and between individuals and the organization as a whole. In the case of the
Forest Service the costs of negotiation differed between the lower level staff and the
central Washington officers. Shifting to a policy of negotiating appeals promised to
benefit the central offices and the agency as a whole by reducing the appeals backlog and
speeding the appeals process. The burden of performing the actual negotiations fell on
lower level workers, however. While negotiation benefits the organization as a whole,
negotiation imposes higher costs on some individuals within the organization. Hence those
individuals may be less motivated to turn to negotiation. Manring recommends three
organizational changes to alleviate this difference in the assessment of the costs of
negotiation. First the organization should adjust the workloads of the negotiators to
reflect the additional time and effort involved in negotiating appeals, thus reducing the
cost to the involved individuals. Second the organization must modify its reward structure
to reflect the new emphasis on negotiation. Rather than simply rewarding workers for
meeting deadlines or reaching targets, workers should be rewarded for exhibiting good
conflict management skills. Third, the organizational culture must change to reflect the
new emphasis on problem-solving and negotiation.</p>
