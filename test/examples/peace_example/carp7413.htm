<p><em>Susan L. Carpenter and W.J.D. Kennedy, Constituencies and Public Information, (San
Francisco: Jossey- Bass, 1988) pp. 46-51, 168-180.</em></p>

<p>Carpenter and Kennedy discuss the importance of building constituency support and
informing the public to the successful management of public disputes. The authors use the
case of the Water Roundtable to illustrate their findings. </p>

<p>The Water Roundtable negotiations were a set of complex, protracted, multiparty
negotiations over water supplies for a major western city. Participants represented
environmental interests, urban and suburban groups, business interests from both the
eastern and western regions of the state, agricultural groups, and western local
governments. Negotiations proceeded remarkably well, and a mutually acceptable agreement
was reached and implemented.</p>

<h3>Effective Constituencies</h3>

<p>Constituents are those people &quot;to whom representatives are responsible and whose
support is required if agreements reached in negotiations are to be implemented.&quot;[p.
169] The authors describe several factors which affect constituency support for their
representatives. These factors include the size of the group and the breadth of views
within the group, method of decision making used within the group, how effectively group
members communicate with each other, the influence of outside organizations, and the
constituents' familiarity with the practices and principles of negotiation. </p>

<p>Carpenter and Kennedy give eight suggestions for building constituency support. Make
sure that all the interests groups are represented, even it that means bringing more
participants into the negotiations. Make sure that the groups and their representatives
establish regular and effective means of communication. Make sure that the decision making
process within the group is clear and acceptable. Respond promptly to disagreements within
a group. Task groups are useful ways to include more constituents directly in the process.
Constituents may need to be educated about the principles and process of negotiations.
They may, for instance, be unfamiliar with the practice of step-by-step negotiations and
with the principles of good faith negotiation. Pace the negotiation process to allow
representatives adequate time to meet with and inform their constituents. Finally, the
authors note that pacing and communication are particularly important during the end
stages of negotiation, when the push to settle may drive the representative ahead of his
or her constituents.</p>

<p>The Water Roundtable negotiations included representatives from the Environmental
Alliance and the Western Water Advisory Council. Both groups had constituents with widely
varying perspectives, but succeeded in uniting to support their respective representative.
The Western Water Advisory Council met frequently. They used consensual decision making so
that minority views were not excluded. They drew on outside experts to gain the needed
understanding of technical issues. The Environmental Alliance was a coalition of seventeen
environmental groups, some of which took very hardline stances and lacked experience with
cooperative problem solving. The Alliance also used consensus decision making. Coalition
representatives met frequently with the Alliance leaders to review progress. Progress
within the Roundtable negotiations and the fear of litigation helped motivate constituent
support.</p>

<h3>Informing the Public</h3>

<p>Carpenter and Kennedy note that &quot;an uninformed public is likely to make up its own
facts, and the misunderstandings become new, separate conflicts that make the original
problem more difficult to solve.&quot;[p. 177] They discuss several ways to keep the
public informed without undermining the privacy needed for successful negotiations. As
noted above, it is important to include representatives of all interest groups in the
negotiation process itself. Members of the public may be brought in as official observers,
or may be appointed to subcommittees. Public meeting are informative, and offer
opportunities for interested individuals to offer comments and suggestions to the
participants. The negotiation organizers may also hold briefing sessions with interested
groups. Direct mailings can also be effective.</p>

<p>The authors suggest three basic principles which should guide any dealings with the
public. First, acknowledge the public's right to know, and the importance of their
concerns. Second, work with existing situations and institutions to disseminate
information, for example, by scheduling meetings to accommodate local publishing
deadlines. Third, expect public skepticism and opposition. These are reasonable responses
to being excluded from negotiations. However they may be overcome in time if thorough and
accurate information is consistently supplied. The Water Roundtable negotiations were
closed to the public, but involved a very active public information campaign. Press
releases and conferences were held after each negotiation session. The Roundtable used
mass mailings and held public meetings across the state. Interested organizations received
informational presentations. Agency managers and technical experts participated in various
task groups for the Roundtable. Task group participants then disseminated negotiation
within their home organizations.</p>
