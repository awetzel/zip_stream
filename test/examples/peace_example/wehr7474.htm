<p>One increasingly common form of social action which illustrates both balanced sociation
in the way it combines positive and negative relations, and &quot;safety valve&quot;
conflict is civil disobedience; an individual or group refuses to obey a law but also
refuses to use violence against those who enforce it. Those committing civil disobedience
simultaneously act negatively and positively toward the enforcers. Such direct opposition
to government policy reflects negative relations while commitment to nonviolence suggests
positive relations. Since the 1960s, US society has become increasingly tolerant of
nonviolent action. It has come to recognize it as a useful safety valve device permitting
conflict and change at minimal cost.&nbsp; The Southern sit-ins of the 1960s in the U.S.
demonstrated how civil disobedience and other forms of nonviolent action can bring about a
society that is more just and less vulnerable to upheaval conflict (Wehr 1968). Black
student protest, guided by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference engaged in highly
emotional conflict at low cost to society. Groups with a grievance in society must have
ways of doing conflict with a hated policy or social structure. In the 1970s and 1980s,
large numbers of North Americans and Europeans used nonviolent action to oppose government
preparations for nuclear war. For nearly two decades, the citizen's movement against the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado combined positive and negative actions to
influence public opinion, government officials, legislators, and plant workers (Downton
and Wehr 1997). As with the civil rights sit-ins, a conflict with great emotional content
and potential for high cost was moderated and served to move the governments and publics
of two nations toward necessary change. </p>
