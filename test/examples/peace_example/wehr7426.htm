<p><em>John Prendergast, &quot;Actors and Approaches to Peacebuilding: The Case of
Sudan,&quot; sect. in Building Peace, by John Paul Lederach, (Washington, D.C.: United
States Institute of Peace, 1997), pp. 153-161.</em></p>

<p>Prendergast analyzes conflict in Sudan using Lederach's models of conflict and
peacebuilding. Sudan has been at war for the better part of forty years. Prendergast
focuses on peacemaking attempts from 1989 onward. In 1989 a coup by the National Islamic
Front (NIF) installed the current Sudanese government. A variety of rebel forces continue
in violent opposition to the NIF.</p>

<p>Lederach describes conflicts in terms of three levels: top level, middle-range, and
grassroots. Top level actors are the main military and political leaders. These leaders
are usually highly publicly visible, and their actions may be sharply constrained by
political considerations. A number of regional and international actors have attempted to
facilitate negotiations between the NIF and rebel forces, with little success. The
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a regional organization covering the
Horn of Africa, has been very active in Sudanese negotiations. IGAD negotiations produced
an agreement on the terms for resolving the Sudanses civil war. However the NIF later
reneged on that agreement. The NIF appears to be fundamentally committed to regional
Islamization, and so there seems to be little room for compromise with more moderate
forces. While IGAD continues to pursue negotiations within Sudan, it also encourages
international pressure on the NIF government, and fosters coordination among the various
rebel groups. Should it prove necessary to remove the NIF by force, it is hoped that a
unified rebel opposition would be better prepared to take over. </p>

<p>Middle-range actors are usually respected figures in business, education or religion.
These actors generally have connections to people in both the top and the grassroots
levels. Extended civil war has eliminated much of the middle-range in Sudan, as the
warring parties have attempted to maximize their control within their territories.
Middle-range peacebuilding attempts have focused largely on arranging meetings between
church leaders from the opposing sides. UN groups, such as UNICEF, both deal with
middle-level actors, and try to encourage and empower moderate middle-level leaders.
Generally such middle-range initiatives are frustrated as the conflict becomes increasing
polarized and dominated by extremists.</p>

<p>Grassroots leaders in Sudan are primarily traditional and tribal authorities. Relief
and development workers also have some grassroots authority. Grassroots actors generally
are constrained by a relative lack of power and the immediate need to survive. In Sudan,
both rebel and NIF forces initiated programs designed to disempower traditional
authorities, and so further consolidate their own power. Nonetheless, Prendergast argues
that &quot;the greatest vitality and innovation in peacebuilding are to be found at the
grassroots level, with diverse responses and initiatives being undertaken that involve
both external agencies and internal actors.&quot;[p. 158] The New Sudan Council of
Churches has trained local villagers to monitor compliance with a local peace agreement.
Violations are reported to village elders. Grassroots leaders have staged local peace
conferences. The Akobo Peace Conference is one notable example. Communities have also
sought to rebuild customary law and traditional courts, in response to the breakdown of
national order during the extended civil war.</p>
