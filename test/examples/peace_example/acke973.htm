<p>Peter Ackerman and Christopher Kruegler, Strategic Nonviolent Conflict, (Westport,
Connecticut: Praeger, 1994).</em></p>

<p>Ackerman and Kruegler argue that the use of nonviolent action in conflicts is on the
increase. They seek to understand the principles of effective nonviolent conflict, and to
explore its potential uses in the contemporary context. Since they take the practitioner's
choice of strategies to be a key factor in the success or failure of nonviolent actions,
much of their work focuses on describing strategies and developing principles to guide
strategic planning. The text consists of nine chapters with an authors' Introduction and
Forewords by Gene Sharp and by Thomas Schelling.</p>

<p>In their Introduction to the text, the authors list a number of features of the
contemporary international scene which may encourage the increased use of nonviolent
action. They note that NGOs are playing larger roles and wielding increasing power in
international affairs. &quot;Nonstate actors may find that their particular attributes and
capabilities make them especially well suited to waging nonviolent conflict.&quot;[xxi] </p>

<p>Ethnic conflicts are on the rise globally. Given the potential of ethnic conflicts to
escalate dramatically and violently, and so to provoke international censure, ethnic
groups may well turn toward nonviolent conflict to press their demands. Marginalized
groups have not been very successful in using terrorism to achieve their goals. Groups
which had resorted to terrorism may turn to nonviolent strategies, which have had a
somewhat better success rate.</p>

<p>Nonviolent resistance may be used as a form of civilian-based national defense. This
approach prepares the general population to use nonviolent resistance should another power
attempt to invade. The goal is to make it impossible to successfully occupy and govern the
invaded territory. Civilian-based defense may be an appealing option to small states which
have no realistic hope of defending themselves by military force.</p>

<p>It has often been thought that nonviolent action is most effective in democratic
states. The authors suggest instead that nonviolent conflict may be a precursor to
democratization. &quot;Effective nonviolent conflict may be shown to precede, abet, and
defend the democratizing process.&quot;[xxiii] And so supporting nonviolent action is one
way to encourage and support democratization.</p>

<p>Finally, they note that technological advances, especially in communications, have made
strategic nonviolence easier to use and more effective. They have also created new
opportunities for nonviolent action. The authors caution, however, that technology in and
of itself does not give an advantage to nonviolent actors. Technology can also be used to
dominate and oppress. Ultimately, nonviolent actors must always out perform their
adversaries in order to succeed. </p>

<p>Chapter One describes the emergence of nonviolent action as a significant feature of in
many contemporary conflicts. They observe that the use of strategies of nonviolence need
not be based on a philosophy of nonviolence. Many contemporary actors simply find
nonviolent actions to be the most effective and least costly, and in most contemporary
conflict some combination of violent and nonviolent action has been used. Nonviolent
actions range from forms of protest and persuasion, to forms of non-cooperation such as
strikes and boycotts, to forms of intervention such as sit-ins.</p>

<p>The authors close Chapter One by raising and rebutting some traditional arguments
against nonviolent actions. Some have argued that it is not possible to produce a
&quot;formula&quot; for effective nonviolent strategy. The authors agree that no simple
formula is possible, but respond that a better understanding of the complex variables at
play is certainly possible and desirable. They also reject the claim that&quot;true&quot;
nonviolence must be understood as a transformative activity and philosophy. Some have
argued that nonviolence cannot succeed in the face of extreme violence and repression.
Here the authors argue by historical cases that nonviolent action can oppose violent
repressive regimes. They note &quot;nonviolent conflict cannot require a kinder and
gentler world in which to prevail, but it may offer (and has offered) a realistic
alternative in the face of political violence as we know it.&quot;[16] </p>

<p>Chapter Two describes twelve principles of strategic action. Each principle addresses a
factor contributing to the success or failure of strategic nonviolent conflict. In
developing a plan for strategic nonviolent action, the actors must formulate clear
achievable goals. They must strengthen their organization, secure needed resources and
support, and seek support from external actors, groups or states. They must also develop a
repertoire of nonviolent actions and tactics. </p>

<p>In engaging in nonviolent conflict the actors must maintain strong discipline, and
refrain from violent action. Violence will cost the group credibility, and dramatically
escalate the conflict. They must mute the effects of the opponents' violence, by avoiding
it or preparing for it. Nonviolent actors should seek to use and publicize the opponent's
violence to undermine domestic and foreign support for the opponent. They should attack
their opponent's strategy for maintaining control and obedience. In their ongoing planning
over the course of the conflict, nonviolent actors must continue to reassess actions and
options as the situation progresses. They must adjust their offensive or defensive
postures in light of new vulnerabilities or strengths. And they must strive to keep their
actions and and goals connected.</p>

<p>In Chapters Three through Eight the authors analyze cases of widespread and sustained
strategic nonviolent conflict. Each case concludes with an analysis of how well the
conflict conformed to the authors' twelve principles of strategic action. Ackerman and
Kruegler examine the use of nonviolence in the First Russian Revolution, between 1904 and
1906. They examine the German use of passive resistance during the French occupation of
the Ruhr region. They analyze the Indian Independence Movement in the 1930, and resistance
to the German occupation of Denmark in the early 1940s. They investigate the use of a
civic strike to depose the General Martinez in El Salvador. And finally they examine the
conflict between the Polish Communist Party and the Solidarity trade union movement in
1980.</p>

<p>Having explored historical uses of nonviolent action, Chapter Nine draws some general
conclusion about what is needed for nonviolent action to succeed. The authors also
evaluate their principles in light of their findings from the historical record. This
chapter includes a chart summarizing each cases' conformity to the twelve principles and
assessing the success or failure of nonviolent action in each case. The authors find no
strong correlation between the ferocity of the opponent and failure of nonviolent action.
Nonviolent action tended to succumb to opponents who applied steady, sustained pressure,
rather than swift repression. Their review of the cases shows that their initial
principles do identify relevant factors in the success of nonviolent action, and that
conforming to those principles did increase the chance of successful action. </p>

<p>The authors draw some general lessons for nonviolent protagonists from their review of
the cases. &quot;First, it seems that it is easier to mobilize for conflict than to wage
it...Second, it seems that the greatest source of counter-productive behavior is
associated with the conception of nonviolent strategy.&quot;[329] Groups tended to make
strategic errors during their ongoing planning over the course of the conflict. They note
that nonviolent actors tend to end their campaigns somewhat prematurely, and often leave
themselves no way to rejoin the conflict. The authors also find that, &quot;not only does
violence mix poorly with nonviolent action, but even the contemplation of opportunistic
violence weakens the effectiveness of strategic nonviolent conflict.&quot;[335]</p>

<p>Ackerman and Kruegler conclude the text with a brief overview of contemporary
conflicts, including Panama, China, the Philippines, East Central Europe, and South
Africa. They express hope that a better understanding of the principles of strategic
nonviolent action will lead to its wider use.</p>
