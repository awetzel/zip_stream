<p>&quot;Report of Conference Key Findings, Ideas, and Recommendations,&quot; in Managing
Conflict in the Post-Cold War World: The Role of Intervention. Report of the August 2-6,
1995, (Aspen, Colorado: Aspen Institute, 1996) pp. 9-26.</i></p>

<p>The 1995 Aspen Institute Conference convened to consider the question, &quot;How can
the international community establish greater stability in the world system at large, and
within that system, what is the role of international intervention?&quot;[p. 10]
International intervention can take many forms, including political, economic, diplomatic,
humanitarian, and military interventions. </p>

<p>Conference participants discussed three main types of potentially violent large-scale
conflicts. First were conflicts between the great powers over the structure of the
emerging post-Cold War international system, and over the distribution of power. Currently
relations between China, Russia, and the United States are potential sites of great power
conflict.</p>

<p>A second area of potential conflict is presented by regional conflicts over the local
distribution of power. At the time of the conference, North Korea, and Iran and Iraq were
seen as having the strongest potential to erupt into violent regional conflict. The third
type of conflicts considered were communal conflicts over &quot;competing identities,
territorial claims, and political institutions.&quot; These include religious and ethnic
conflicts. Communal conflicts have increased in number and intensity since the end of the
Cold War, especially the former Soviet states and Africa. Such conflicts tend to Wi the
least international concern, and yet have the potential to become very costly, spread,
produce human rights abuses including, possibly, genocide. Communal conflicts were
predicted to be the most common form of violent conflict in the future. Therefore
conference participants tended to focus on the role of international intervention in
communal conflict.</p>

<p>Conference participants recounted some of the main questions raised when nations
consider intervening in communal conflicts. Two questions usually arise first. Is
intervention in the outside nations' interest? Is intervention a moral imperative? These
two influences are often found in tension.</p>

<p>Considerations of national interest lead to the further question: What are the costs of
intervention, as compared with the costs of inaction? Conference participants agreed that
more consideration should be given to the costs of inaction that tends to be given
currently. Moral considerations prompt the broader question: At what point do moral
concerns become imperative? The conference participants suggested that genocide should be
recognized as a moral threshold. Genocide requires international intervention.</p>

<p>The most pragmatic question is &quot;Whose money and whose kids?&quot;[p. 12] This is a
key question, since it summarizes so many basic concerns. This is the question which most
tends to frame domestic and international debates over proposed interventions.</p>

<p>As agreement on the need for intervention is reached, the further question then arises:
Who should lead or coordinate interventions? Given the United States' present status,
conference participants agreed that the U.S. must take a leadership role in building an
effective international system. U.S. failure to participate would undermine the power and
credibility of any other international system or undertaking. However, the U.S. will need
to share power with other nations. And leadership entails taking on a share of the risks
and costs of the venture. </p>

<p>There are a wide array of interventions available to nations. To date there is no
coordinated or principled system for using the various techniques. Often nations have
rushed to employ military intervention. Conference participants stressed the need to
develop and employ other, non-military means of intervention.</p>

<p>Similarly there are a number of international organizations through which intervention
into violent conflicts could occur. However, many of these organizations, such as NATO,
were designed to deal with the interstate conflicts typical of the Cold War. Conference
participants agreed that such organizations need to be updated, and that they should be
given greater roles in peacekeeping.</p>

<p>The United Nations in particular has been overburdened. The UN's successful
intervention in Kuwait during the Gulf War produced unrealistic expectations in many
member states. Many nations then &quot;dumped&quot; their problems and conflicts on the
UN. UN peacekeeping has had a number of successes. Unfortunately the UN's failures tend to
be better remembered. While this has revealed many shortcomings of the UN system, it has
also prompted unjustified criticism, and damaged the UN's reputation and effectiveness. </p>

<p>Conference discussions about the future of the UN produced agreement on a number of
points. First and most pointedly, it was agreed that &quot;states should not dump
difficult problems on the United Nations, provide inadequate political will and resources,
and then blame [the UN] for not acting strongly enough.&quot; In addition, UN capabilities
should continue to be enhanced, particularly in its non-enforcement and humanitarian
areas. For the present, conference participants suggested that regional organizations may
be better situated to supply peace enforcement in communal conflicts.</p>

<p>In addition to intervention in full-blown violent conflicts, conference participants
discussed preemptive intervention. Preemptive intervention seeks to make an early,
decisive intervention to end or reduce violent conflict. Such interventions may be
military. However we do not yet fully understand how to make effective military
intervention in communal conflicts. Other forms of preemptive intervention may include use
of human rights observers, shows of force, diplomatic or economic sanctions, and
intervention to limit or eliminate hate propaganda. The conference participants agreed
that more emphasis on preemptive intervention was needed.</p>

<p>Conference participants also stressed that conflict prevention would be preferable to
intervention. One key to improved prevention of violent conflict is greater regional
integration. Such multilateral regional partnerships will facilitate better early
detection, more stability, and would create powerful organizations to deal with other
threats to global stability. Increased economic growth, development and prosperity would
also tend to prevent conflicts. </p>

<p>Based on the conference discussions, participants developed a set of guidelines for
planning and implementing international interventions into violent conflicts. When
planning an intervention, the intervening nations must have a robust appreciation for, and
understanding of, the broader context in which the present conflict occurs. Intervening
nations should undertake a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the proposed
intervention. Participants stressed the importance of having &quot;clear, achievable
objectives and a strategy to achieve those objectives.&quot;[p. 18] Planning should
include an exit strategy. Nations must then muster the political will to implement that
strategy, including the will, where relevant, to use military force. Participants agreed
in cautioning that &quot;the international community must avoid issuing threats and
failing to follow through. Failed intervention efforts and empty threats of action
embolden aggressors.&quot;[p. 18]</p>

<p>Effective implementation of a planned intervention requires a swift effective
decision-making process. Leaders must have clear principles of accountability. Over the
course of the intervention process, intervening nations must maintain unity and support
among themselves, with the interventions forces, and with their respective publics.
Conference participants caution against allowing intervention forces to be taken hostage,
or directly targeted. Finally effective intervention requires effective follow-through.
Provisions must be made for disarming combatants and reintegrating them into their
society. </p>

<p>Polls show that the American public is generally willing to intervene in cases
involving terrorism, energy supplies and oil, proliferation and humanitarian crises. They
are generally willing to employ military force if necessary, but prefer non-military
intervention whenever possible. Americans support the UN. Usually, public opinion can be
swayed by decisive action by the nation's leadership.</p>

<p>International opinion tends to exaggerate the American public's reluctance to become
involved in international conflicts. This tends to undermine other nation's confidence in
the United State's reliability as an international leader. Such perceptions also fuel the
concern that the U.S will tend to act unfairly, unilaterally pursuing it own best
interests.</p>
