<p>The civil war in Nicaragua in the 1980s illustrates the way opposing sides can shift
away from threat-heavy power mixes to more balanced ones (Wehr and Nepstad 1994). The
Sandinista government was in conflict with both US-supported Contra forces in the North
and South and Atlantic Coast indigenous groups in the East. From mid-decade on, these
opponents were increasingly persuaded by diplomats and changing regional and global
contexts to alter their strategy mixes toward cooperative resolution. Initially, those
mixes on all sides were heavy with threat and violent force. Then, cease-fires were
arranged and exchange behavior increased, with violent sanctions in the threat sector
increasingly replaced with nonviolent ones. Integrative behavior expanded as negotiated
agreements were implemented. Regional autonomy and subsequent reconciliation was worked
out with the Atlantic Coast peoples. National elections were agreed to and resulted in
1990 in a peaceful transfer of power and a subsequent uneasy mutual tolerance among former
adversaries. </p>

<p>A moderating shift in participants' power mixes occurs largely in response to the
political context of the conflict. Some aspects of that context within Nicaragua itself
were especially influential: the important role of religious organizations; the moderating
influence of women in the Sandinista revolution. Changes in the global political context
were also important; the Cold War was winding down, thus reducing the U.S.-Soviet military
confrontation in Central America. Perhaps most important, was the changing Central
American context; regional leaders had created the Esquipulas process and structure for
resolving civil wars throughout the region. Opposing sides in Nicaragua used Esquipulas to
expand their exchange and integration interaction with one another.</p>
