<p>Susan L. Carpenter and W.J.D. Kennedy, &quot;Developing an Effective Program of
Conflict Management: Ten Principles,&quot; chapt. in Managing Public Disputes, (San
Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1988), pp. 52-65.</p>

<p>The authors offer ten basic principles for dealing effectively with public disputes.
First, conflict managers must remember that conflicts are made up of substantive issues,
human relationships, and procedures. A narrow focus on the substantive issues will not
resolve the conflict. In order to resolve conflicts, equal attention must also be given to
human relations and emotions, as well as to developing fair procedures. Next, in order to
find a solution, the conflict manager must first understand the problem. This requires
identifying and clarifying the parties' needs, fears, and goals, and exploring past and
present patterns of interaction between the parties. </p>

<p>It is also important for conflict managers to resist the pressure to resolve a conflict
quickly. The manger must take the time to formulate a strategy and must then stick to that
strategy. Short-cuts and quick fixes will not resolve the underlying issues. Taking time
at the beginning to craft a general plan for addressing the conflict will save time and
effort in the long run. The authors also caution that, while mangers need to stick to that
general plan, the conflict resolution process itself must remain flexible. Often the
process will need to be modified as the situation develops and new facts arise. Another
principle is that mangers should try to anticipate what might go wrong in negotiations.
The manager's general plan should include techniques for managing the sorts of negotiation
problems that are likely to arise. In order to make progress in resolving a conflict, the
parties and managers must have a positive working relationship. Parties must communicate
and have some trust in each other. Lack of communication leads to polarization, and
hostile relations lead to conflict escalation. Parties to a conflict must also work
together to develop a constructive definition of their problem. The authors note that
&quot;whenever possible, an issue should be defined as a mutual problem to be
solved.&quot;[p. 59] Simple yes-no formulations of the problem should be avoided. Just as
parties must help define the problem, parties should help design the conflict resolution
process and the conflict solution. The manger should not impose her own process on the
parties, nor attempt to &quot;sell&quot; the parties on her own solution. Parties are more
accepting of solutions which they themselves have developed. Next, managers should
emphasize issues rather than positions. Positions are more likely to be mutually
exclusive. By focusing on the basic issues, parties may come to understand the other
sides' concerns and discover compatible or even shared interests.</p>

<p>Finally, conflict mangers should remember the basic principle, &quot;Do no harm.&quot;
Conflict management programs which are poorly conceived and designed, or which do not
allow adequate time to complete the process, can have bad effects. Participants may become
frustrated and hostile. The conflict may escalate. Their bad experience may prejudice the
parties against other attempts at conflict management. </p>
