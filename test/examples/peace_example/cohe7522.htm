<p>Conflicts Over the Sale of Nuclear Fuel Between the U.S. and India</p>

<p>Selection from: Raymond Cohen, Negotiating Across Cultures: Communication Obstacles in
International Diplomacy, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1991),
pp. 74-5.</p>

<p>Conflicts over the sale of nuclear fuel between the U.S. and India during the early
1980s were complicated by India's tactic of portraying the conflict as a moral issue. In
1963 the U.S. contracted to build a nuclear power plant in India. The contract specified
that the U.S. would act as the sole and guaranteed supplier of nuclear fuel for the
thirty-year term of the contract.</p>

<p>In 1974 India exploded a nuclear bomb. In 1978 the U.S. Congress passed the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Act which required buyer nations to agree to restrictions on the uses of
American supplied nuclear fuels. India refused to accept such restrictions and fuel
shipments were held up. </p>

<p>India then attempted to hold the U.S. to the terms of its initial 1963 contract. India
framed their grievance as a moral matter. First, the U.S. was obligated to keep its
original 1963 promise to supply fuel. Second, latter U.S. attempts to restrict the uses of
that fuel to non-military programs were unfair and hypocritical given America's own
nuclear stockpile. Having framing the dispute as a matter of moral principle, India was
uninterested in compromises or alternate solutions. The dispute was not resolved until
India made the political decision to seek improved relations with the U.S. India relaxed
the moral aspect of its complaints. Cohen observes, &quot;given the political will, a
simple solution was found: France would now supply the fuel.&quot;[p. 75] </p>
