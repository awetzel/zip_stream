<h1 align="center">The Violence-Negotiation Nexus: South Africa in Transition and the
Politics of Uncertainty</h1>

<hr>

<p>Sisk examines South Africa's transition to democracy and finds that negotiations are
actually correlated with a rise in political violence. Sisk tries to explain this
violence- negotiation nexus, and explores ways of dealing with such negotiation associated
violence. </p>

<p>Understanding the Violence-Negotiation Nexus</p>

<p>Conditions were ripe for a negotiated settlement when the African National Congress
(ANC) and the white minority government both realized that they were locked in a mutually
harmful stalemate. Negotiations for a transition to majority rule opened in 1990. However,
rather than the expected decrease in tensions, political violence actually increased well
above apartheid-era rates. Annual deaths from political violence ranged from 500 to 1250
in the late 1980s. The death rate ranged from 2250 to 3750 in the early 1990s, during the
transition negotiations. Sisk did find that the nature of the violence differed.
Apartheid-era political violence was generally limited to violence between the white
regime and black liberation forces. While this type of violence continued during
negotiations, there was also an increase in political violence between a variety of
factions for a range of purposes. </p>

<p>Sisk considers structural factors and triggering events which could account for the
violence. The disenfranchisement of the black majority is the primary factor creating a
predisposition toward violence. Areas of violent conflict are usually highly urbanized
with very high levels of unemployment, and a scarcity of basic resources. Sisk notes that
&quot;in these desperately poor, urban and semi-urban communities, social rules are eroded
and alternative social structures (such as gangs and warlords) thrive.&quot;[p. 82]
Influxes of rural migrant workers add to the tension, as the more traditional rural
workers often clash with the more radical urban groups. While some theorists suggest that
ethnic differences play a role creating conflict, Sisk argues that conflicts along ethnic
lines are actually expressions of deeper insecurities. Given these structural factors,
almost any event can serve to trigger violence. Triggering events have included political
rallies, strikes, assassinations, random attacks, and even apolitical crimes of passion. </p>

<p>To explain the upswing in violence during negotiations, Sisk turns from general
structural factors to political conditions. Transitional negotiations mark a time of great
political uncertainty. There is a lack of defined political rules as the rules of the old
regime are rejected, and the rules of the new are yet to be formulated. This is also a
time of high expectations by many actors who hope to gain power in the new regime. Sisk
says, &quot;Expectations peak as the moment of political realignment nears; parties and
groups may expect to gain in the new game, or to lose. As each negotiation-related event
occurs and a new step in the writing of the rules is made, uncertainty and expectations
crescendo in an overwhelming sense of fear and insecurity.&quot;[p. 90] This fear and
insecurity leads parties to resort to political violence as a &quot;beyond-the-table&quot;
tactic to influence negotiations and gain political ends.</p>

<p>Sisk finds three basic motives behind this tactical use of political violence. Actors
may employ violence in order to derail the negotiation process. This may be the goal of
extremists who oppose any compromise. Actors who fear being marginalized in negotiations
may use violence, and the threat of further violence, to insure that their interests are
addressed. Finally, actors may use violence to destabilize and so weaken an opponent. It
is hoped that this will also strengthen the hand of their own negotiators, by
demonstrating their side's ability disrupt the negotiation process.</p>

<p>Controlling Political Violence</p>

<p>Negotiations in South Africa were undertaken in response to a mutually harmful, violent
stalemate. Yet negotiations have triggered further political violence. Sisk observes that
&quot;the more politicians seek to control political violence, the more it flares. The
more it flares, the more difficult it is to make the concessions needed to reach a
settlement.&quot; </p>

<p>Sisk examines the failure of the 1991 peace accord between the ANC and rival IFP.
Leaders of the two parties reached an agreement. The accord was heavily publicized in the
strife-torn areas, with pamphlets declaring &quot;Leaders Make Peace.&quot; However,
violence continued and even increased. Soon even the leadership abandoned the accord. Sisk
points out that violence cannot be controlled from the top down. Leaders must be able to
demobilize their constituencies, but the ANC and IFP were unable to do so. Given the fear
and insecurity motivating such political violence, leaders generally will not have the
power to simply demobilize their constituencies with the announcement of a peace pact. </p>

<p>For this reason, Sisk argues that peace pacts should focus on joint management of
political violence. The central element of this strategy is that creation of a shared set
of rules. The presence of shared rules will itself help to reduce the uncertainty which is
a source of political violence. Another important element of this management strategy is
to include leaders of all the parties. With joint management comes joint responsibility.
Management should focus on de- politicizing the violence, at least around central issues,
so that concessions and negotiations on those issues can proceed. </p>

<p>The National Peace Accord exemplifies the joint management approach. The Accord created
a National Peace Committee, made up of leaders from each group, which is the final
authority on all disputes and cases of political violence. The Accord sets forth a code of
conduct governing the behavior of all political parties and the police. It specifies the
rights and responsibilities of all parties, creates specific procedures for dealing with
cases of violence, and contains explicit enforcement provisions. It focuses on violence
management at the regional and local levels by establishing regional and local peace
committees, and acknowledges the ongoing nature of violence management by creating
permanent task forces with full-time mediators. </p>

<p>There have been some difficulties in implementing the National Peace Accord. The main
problem has been noncompliance. While the Accord does include enforcement provisions, they
are not sufficiently strong. Regional and local committees have been difficult to
establish. They lack sufficient government resources, and have had difficulty in getting
local leaders to participate. In addition, moderate leaders willing to participate in the
peace process have been targeted for assassination. Where local committees have been
established, their work has been hindered by the climate of intimidation.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>Sisk argues that transitional negotiations produce uncertainty and heightened
expectations, which produce fear and insecurity, which lead to the use of violence as a
beyond- the-table tactic to influence negotiations. While the violence associated with
transitional negotiations may undermine those negotiations, Sisk hypothesizes that this
need not always be the case. He suggests that &quot;violence tends to polarize and impede
negotiations when one single party is clearly culpable. But, when all parties are deemed
by observers, especially the international community, as equally culpable, incidents of
violence reinforce pressures on them to negotiate.&quot;[p. 90] Generally, the best
approach to negotiation-inspired political violence is a management approach, aimed at
allowing the main negotiations to proceed. Ultimately, the solution to such political
violence is to reach a settlement in the main negotiations. Such a settlement would
establish new rules which would alleviate the uncertainty of the transition period, and
would finalize groups' statuses. </p>
