<p>During the early 1990s the United Nations (UN) cooperated with the Organization of
American States (OAS) to end violent conflict in Central America. On their own initiative,
regional members of the OAS agreed to a general set of intermediate goals on the path to
peace in the region. Under the skillful leadership of Costa Rican President Arias, the
member nations were able to maintain enough mutual trust and goodwill to begin
implementing peacekeeping measures.</p>

<p>UN organizations, in cooperation with the OAS, were to assist in and monitor the
implementation of the agreement. UN forces patrolled the borders of Nicaragua, Honduras
and El Salvador in order to detect or prevent illegal weapons trafficking. UN observers
supervised Nicaraguan elections, and certified the results.</p>

<p>The UN Secretary-General played a crucial role in the successes of the OAS plan. First,
the Secretary-General consulted and supervised the OAS plan and its implementation. The
respect and prestige accorded the Secretary-General by the international community in turn
lent credibility to the OAS activities. Second, OAS member states themselves trusted and
respected the office of the UN Secretary-General. Nicaragua was willing to allow UN
oversight of their elections. El Salvador appealed to the Secretary-General to make his
good offices available to help resolve its growing civil political rifts.</p>
