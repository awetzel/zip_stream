<p>Conflict groups can develop ways of doing conflict that permit escalation while
controlling runaway processes. For example, negative mutual reinforcement can be
interrupted and shifted from violent to nonviolent force. Proliferation of issues can be
prevented if conflict groups limit the struggle to one issue at a time. Interpersonal
antagonism and hostility can be avoided if conflict group leaders make a serious effort to
maintain cordial personal relations with their counterparts. Distorted information can be
minimized through a shared system of rumor control and open communication between leaders.
The chance of leader extremism can be reduced through training of second-level leaders in
how to moderate conflict.&nbsp; Confrontation should be seen as a self-conscious and
bi-directional process of power-testing, constantly escalating and de-escalating. &nbsp;
Another way for conflict groups to control escalation is to frame the conflict as a joint
struggle with their opponents for an acceptable transformation of their relationship. The
outcome would not involve the elimination or diminution of either, simply an altered
relationship acceptable to both. The conflict would be moderated by certain rules and
principles.&nbsp; Challenges, then, would be less threatening, less absolute since they
would not require the elimination of an opponent.&nbsp; </p>
