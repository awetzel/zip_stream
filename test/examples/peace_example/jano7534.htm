<p><em>Robert Janosik, &quot;Rethinking the Culture-Negotiation Link,&quot; in Negotiation
Theory and Practice, eds. J. William Breslin and Jeffery Z. Rubin, (Cambridge: The Program
on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, 1991), pp. 235-246.</em></p>

<p>The relation between culture and negotiation styles has been the topic of much
investigation and research in recent times. Janosik, however, argues that the term
&quot;culture&quot; is understood differently by different authors. These different
notions of culture yield different understandings of the culture-negotiation link. Having
surveyed the literature Janosik finds four distinct approaches to understanding the impact
of culture on negotiation.</p>

<p>The first approach views culture as learned behavior. It focuses on actions, without
giving much attention to the reasons behind those actions. Researchers following this
approach observe that certain types of behavior are common to certain cultures, and
attempt to catalog those behaviors. Some of the earliest investigations into cultural
differences take this form. The approach tends to yield cross-cultural negotiation
etiquette guides, or how-to manuals. Such general yet definite advise is often helpful to
practitioners. However, Janosik notes that this approach has difficulty accounting for
individual variations in negotiation styles. </p>

<p>The second approach views culture as a matter of shared basic values. For this approach
&quot;the assumption, simply put, is that thinking precedes doing, and that one's thinking
patterns derive from one's cultural context.&quot;[p. 237] Researchers try to discover the
basic values and attitudes of a particular culture, and then to deduce patterns of
negotiation behavior from those basic beliefs. Cultures are often classified as belonging
to certain basic types: direct or indirect, adaptive or interventionist. Some versions of
this approach describe cultures in terms of a consistent set of basic values. Other
versions focus on the ideological context of thought and negotiating behavior. Whereas the
learned behavior approach merely describes differing behaviors, this approach attempts to
explain those behaviors. However, this approach also has difficulty in accounting for
individual variations in negotiation styles.</p>

<p>A third approach understands cultures as shaped by the dialectic tension between
paired, opposing values. American culture, for instance, can be seen as shaped by the
tension between the values of collectivism and individualism, or pragmatism and idealism,
or spirituality and materialism. This approach has the advantage of being dynamic where
the previous approaches were static. It can explain changes in a culture over time as
shifts in the balance between opposing values. And it can explain individual variations in
negotiating style as different personal interpretations of the same basic tensions. While
this approach is more interesting to the academic, it is less helpful to the negotiation
practitioner, since it gives less definite answers to what to expect in a given
circumstance.</p>

<p>The fourth approach draws on a systems theory and offers multi-causal explanations of
negotiating behavior. Basic values are seen as only one cause among many. Human behavior
is shaped by a complex set of factors including individual personality, cultural values,
and the social context. Negotiating behavior will vary depending upon a wide range of
factors, such as the participant's age, religion, class, or character, relations of
authority, institutional setting, the opponent's behavior, and even the presence or
absence of an audience. Academic analysts currently favor this approach. Its complexity
gives more nuanced explanations. However this same complexity makes it even less useful as
a predictive tool, and so as a useful guide for negotiation practitioners. </p>

<p>Janosik concludes by locating the above approaches to understanding negotiation
behavior within an even greater split in the field of negotiation theory. Early
negotiation theorists tended to take an economic approach to negotiation. The economic
model sees negotiator behavior as shaped primarily by rational decision-making aimed at
maximizing the actor's outcome. Social psychologists have since offered models of
negotiation behavior which take unconscious psychological and situational factors into
account, and which are correspondingly more complex and indeterminate. Attempts to measure
the effects of culture on negotiating behavior fall within this broader social
psychological approach. Approaches which rely on simplified notions of culture and
rational choice theory are attractive in part because they offer determinate accounts of
negotiation behavior and relatively simple predictive models. Janosik cautions however
that this appeal should not prevent us from undertaking studies which rely on rather more
sophisticated notions of culture. Such approaches are messier but are potentially more
accurate and ultimately more rewarding.</p>
