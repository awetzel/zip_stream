<h1>Managing Communications</h1>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Managing Communications,&quot; Peace Watch, Vol. II, No. 5 (August 1996) p. 1-2.</p>

<p>This newsletter presents an overview of a series of panel discussions held during the
U.S. Institute for Peace's 1996 conference on &quot;Managing Communications: Lessons from
Interventions in Africa.&quot; Conference participants agreed that better communication
between relief organizations, governments and the military would make humanitarian
interventions less costly and more effective.</p>

<p>Civilian relief organizations and military peacekeeping forces share common goals, and
so should be natural allies. Yet, conference attendees noted, &quot;differences in their
professional cultures, the lack of familiarity with each other's methods, and imperfect
communications in the field can lead to misunderstandings or poor coordination of effort
and handicap these [peacekeeping] operations.&quot;[p. 1] Better communication would lead
to better cooperation, and so more efficient operations. Conference attendees discussed a
variety of specific proposals, but agreed that the key to improved communication is
flexibility and trust. </p>
