<p>Dennis Sandole and Hugo van der Merwe Conflict Resolution Theory and Practice.</em></p>

<p>Borrowing from Chilean experience, Salvadorian priests act as intermediaries in the
contrition and forgiveness interactions. These transactions seek to heal the breach caused
by the human rights abuses of the Salvadorian military and police. The priests offered to
hear and hold confidential the confessions of soldiers who had committed rights violations
and murders. In turn the Priest would pass on the confessed information regarding the fate
of &quot;disappeared&quot; persons, and the locations of their bodily remains, to the
grieving families. Remorseful soldiers thus could relieve their consciences without fear
of severe retribution, and families could receive information on the fates of their loved
ones. By acting as intermediaries and acknowledging the soldier's contrition, the priests
have helped to produce reconciliation in the larger community. </p>
