<p><em>Paul Wehr. Resolving an Environmental Conflict Through Values Mapping</em></p>

<p>Values mapping was developed to help resolve a conflict over Adam's Rib, a proposed ski
area in Western Colorado. Residents of the county involved were deeply divided over the
proposal. The decision to approve or disapprove the ski area was to be made by the county
commissioners.&nbsp; A vote of the population was not possible. The commissioners had only
comments from interest groups on either side to guide their decision. </p>

<p>A survey was done of a random sample of county residents. They were asked to create
their preferred future for the county, choosing differing amounts of several community
values (for example open space, educational quality, pace of life, economic vitality).
These value preferences were then combined into scenarios which illustrated the preferred
future of county residents. That future was then compared with predictions from impact
assessment studies to give a rough measure of the degree to which the changes from ski
development would approximate the citizens' preferred future. </p>

<p>In this case, values mapping was used by the third party with the decisional
responsibility, and it led to a decision to disapprove the proposed ski area. But there is
no reason why the same technique would not facilitate cooperative resolution in
interpersonal and intergroup conflict. </p>
