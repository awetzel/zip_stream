<h1>Starting Negotiations</h1>

<h2>Louis Kriesberg</h2>

<p>Selection from: Kriesberg, Louis, &quot;Starting Negotiations,&quot; chapter in<i>
International Conflict Resolution</i>, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992) pp.
91-110.</p>

<p>Kriesberg draws on the history of U.S.-Soviet relations during the Cold War to
illustrate various de-escalation strategies. Strategic choices accompanying a
de-escalation initiative include the use of inducements, the selection of parties for
negotiation, and the choice of issues.</p>

<p>Inducements</p>

<p>De-escalation initiatives may be accompanied by major or minor positive inducements, no
inducement, or by coercion. President Kennedy's 1963 speech at the American University was
a major conciliatory gesture. His speech called for a reexamination of American attitudes
toward the Soviet Union, and included a promise to stop atmospheric nuclear tests.
Similarly the Soviet peace initiative of the mid-1950s included major positive
inducements. The USSR substantially reduced their uniformed military, withdrew from
Finland, and reopened diplomatic relations with West Germany. President Johnson's 1964
decision to limit U.S. production of fissionable materials was a minor inducement. It was
aimed at encouraging the Soviets to negotiate further, mutual reductions. The Cold War
offers many examples of de-escalation initiatives which were not accompanied by any
particular inducements. Poland's 1957 Rapacki Plan proposed to make Central Europe a
nuclear-free zone. Proponents stressed that implementing the Plan would benefit everyone,
however no additional gestures or positive inducements were made. De-escalation
initiatives have also been accompanied by threats. Krushchev backed Soviet calls to
normalize the Berlin situation with a threat. If the Berlin situation were not improved,
the USSR would turn access to West Berlin over to the German Democratic Republic. U. S.
President Reagan argues that the threat of his Star Wars military build-up was a key
factor in bringing the Soviets back to arms control negotiations.</p>

<p>Choosing Parties</p>

<p>When a de-escalation initiative calls for talks, it must specify who such talks would
include. Big Four negotiations held during the early post-WWII period were multilateral.
Big Four negotiations were direct negotiations between American, French, British, and
Soviet delegations. In later year the Soviets insisted on bilateral negotiations, seeking
more parity. Either the Soviets would negotiate directly and solely with the U.S., or each
side would bring its allies to negotiations. Two-sided, multilateral negotiations,
involving coalition partners from each side of the conflict, have been rare. Krushchev
proposed non-aggression negotiations between NATO and Warsaw Pact nations, but such
negotiations were never held. Multilateral negotiation proposals were more successful when
they involved use of an intermediary. In the 1960s the UN succeeded in bringing together
American, Soviet and unaligned nations for talks in the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament
Committee.</p>

<p>Issues</p>

<p>Issues may be central or peripheral, isolated or linked. U.S.-Soviet de-escalation
initiatives have tended to focus on central issues, such as arms control and human rights.
However, progress may be possible on peripheral issues even when there is no agreement
over central issues. For example, the U.S. and USSR agreed to make Antarctica a
demilitarized zone in 1958, long before they had made any headway on more central issues. </p>

<p>Kissinger's approach to détente is an example of linking issues. While formal,
official negotiations were addressing issues separately, Kissinger also cultivated
back-channel negotiations which linked the issues together in an effort to achieve a more
comprehensive agreement. </p>
