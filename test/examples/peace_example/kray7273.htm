<h1>Mediation by Religious Leaders</h1>

<h2>Ron Kraybill</h2>

<hr>
<em>

<p>Kraybill, Ron. &quot;Directors' Circle.&quot; MCS Conciliation Quarterly. Spring, 1988.
V. 7, No. 2. P. 12.</em> </p>

<p>Ron Kraybill identifies four characteristics that make international mediation by a
religious person often more preferable than peacemaking initiatives offered by political
figures. Those characteristics are (1) putting belief in God above loyalty to the nation.
The religious person can move beyond his or her national interests toward more broad
perception of human existence. Kraybill believes that a religious person has a conscience
of a &quot;global citizen.&quot; (2) A religious person brings spiritual qualities into
the mediation process which include &quot;humility, vulnerability, empathy, quiet candor,
patience&quot; (p. 12). This allows him to establish trustful relations with the parties.
(3) A religious person is truly impartial; his or her agenda is the parties' well-being.
(4) A religious person's powerlessness is his or her strength since it gives parties more
independence in their decisions and there is more likelihood of transforming the mediation
into negotiation (not requiring the presence of facilitator). The experience of John Paul
Lederach in Nicaragua is a good example. Nicaraguans are distrustful of Americans after
their decades of influence in the internal affairs of the country. Nicaraguans have
stopped allowing Americans to be present at the table of negotiation of domestic
Nicaraguan issues. However, they often made exclusions for John Paul because he was a
religious person, which meant that he could be trusted. </p>
