<p>Storytelling is valuable in the transformation of conflict because it breaks down
barriers and allows people to communicate freely. In telling a story, one can explain
strong convictions and points of view without directing them at the opposing party. In
addition, one can reminisce with another through storytelling and break down any tension
through a common bond of shared memories. Storytelling can also give people insight into
how others feel by its very nature: one can place oneself &quot;in another's shoes,&quot;
and thus relate to that person's life experiences. Finally, storytelling gives us the
option of retelling a conflict and giving it a positive ending, opening people's minds to
the possibility of resolution. This article gives specific examples of conflict
transformation through storytelling.</p>
