<h1>Quebec Nationalism: the Quest for Identity</h1>

<hr>

<p>&quot;<em>Quebec nationalism: the quest for identity&quot;, in Interaction, 1992, vol.
4 (3), pg.12.</em></p>

<p>This article summarizes a discussion about identity and nationalism in Quebec society.
Two perspectives are offered from a French speaking person in Quebec, Denise Helly, and an
English speaking person, Don Taylor, from Quebec as well. Both Taylor and Helly
acknowledge a strong connection between nationalism and identity-for both English and
French speakers. Taylor explains the Anglophones feel threatened within Quebec as much as
the Quebecois do within Canada. Both discuss the feelings of not being able to express
one's own identity within their hometowns, while separately they explore how identity is
shaped by laws and surrounding cultural practices.</p>

<p>Helly's discussion also addresses the concept of power as a means of expressing
identity. She notes that when a party has political or economic power, they are able to
more freely express their identity and be assured of cultural survival (which to
Francophones, primarily means being able to speak their own language).</p>

<p>Taylor addresses the issue that when the concept of multiculturalism was introduced in
the 1970's, both Francophones and Anglophones felt threatened. Francophones felt that they
would now be considered just &quot;one more little group,&quot; while Anglophones thought
multiculturalism caused them to be &quot;treated as one of a number of minorities.&quot;
Actions since then are a result of both groups acting out of fear that their cultural
experience and identity may be erased. Taylor concludes that in it's search for national
identity, Quebec cannot ignore the fact that others live within its boarders as well.</p>
