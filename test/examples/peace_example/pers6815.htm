<p>This article is about the work on interpersonal conflict resolution in refugee camps in
Serbia by the MOST group for non-violent conflict resolution. Difficult living conditions
in refugee camps (lack of facilities; the necessity to share them) created many
interpersonal disagreements. The situation was worsened by the sense of hopelessness that
people brought from the places which they had to flee. They shared horrible stories of the
war and of failed attempts to make their lives better. This circular motion of pain
produced more sorrow. To break these dynamics, MOST organized activities in summer camps
for refugees to teach people problem solving skills and active listening, promoting more
understanding between them. They used such techniques as &quot;Communication Games&quot;,
the &quot;Secret Friend&quot; game and workshops with an emphasis on conflict analysis.
The &quot;Secret Friend&quot; game created an atmosphere of joy. People were coming up
with creative ideas for how to make another person happily surprised. In analyzing their
relationships, people were exercising active listening techniques and learned to recognize
each others' needs. Going from there, they tried to create solutions. The author concludes
that the work done by MOST produced encouraging results in improving refugee's relations
and their view of life. </p>
