<p>Goodby examines the potential for a number of European international organizations to
fulfill collective security roles. Goodby defines collective security as &quot;a policy
that commits governments to develop and enforce broadly accepted international rules and
to seek to do so through collective action legitimized by representative international
organizations.&quot;[p. 237]</p>

<p>On his approach, collective security is better understood as a strategy and process,
rather than as a condition.</p>

<p>Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) </p>

<p>The OSCE was formed in 1990 as the permanent successor to the Conference on Security
and Cooperation. The OSCE was envisioned as playing a regional peacekeeping role, as per
Chapters 6 and 8 of the UN Charter. Currently the OSCE focuses on providing early warnings
of conflicts, and on providing early consultations on emerging crises. To this end,the
OSCE has made fact-finding missions to Albania, Yugoslavia, and a number of the former
Soviet republics. In 1994 the OSCE offered to provide a multinational peacekeeping force
in the event that a cease-fire was reached in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the
Transcaucasus. The OCSE mandate emphasizes peacekeeping activities which complement and
facilitate political conflict resolution processes. The OCSE model does not provide for
operations oriented toward crisis management, peace-enforcement or imposing settlements.
And so Goodby concludes that the OCSE is positioned to play a significant, but limited
role in European collective security.</p>

<p>North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</p>

<p>NATO was formed in 1949 as a collective defense organization, and so is well-equipped
to perform military peacekeeping and security missions. NATO has the added advantage of an
existing, well-integrated multinational command structure. NATO's first collective
security action came in 1992 with the enforcement of sanctions on Yugoslavia. Subsequent
activities have included enforcement of the Bosnia no-fly zones, air-strikes in defense of
Sarajevo and Gorazde, and protection of UN ground troops. </p>

<p>The North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) was formed in 1991 to provide a link
between NATO and former Warsaw Treaty Organization member states. The Partnership for
Peace (PFP) created in 1994, establishes a framework for cooperation between NATO and
other European states. PFP has resulted in nearly thirty nations agreeing to cooperate in
military training, and in other activities which emphasize peacekeeping.</p>

<p>NATO is positioned to play a major role in European peacekeeping and regional security.
However, NATO's activities will likely be limited by Russia's unwillingness to have NATO
operate within former Soviet territory. Goodby suggests that NATO and the NACC could
complement the OCSE, by providing crisis and enforcement services while the OCSE focuses
on human rights monitoring and facilitating long-term conflict resolution. </p>

<p>Western European Union (WEU)</p>

<p>WEU was originally created in 1954 to rearm West Germany in preparation for joining
NATO. Largely inactive since its inception, in 1992 the European Community (EC)
resurrected WEU as its military arm. WEU member states are all also members of NATO. One
advantage WEU had over NATO was that France found it easier to act within the WEU
framework. Lately however France has been warming toward NATO. Two disadvantages of WEU
are that it lacks the integrated command structure and planning and logistical resources
of NATO.</p>

<p>France proposed using WEU troops to intervene early in the Yugoslavian conflict. The
United Kingdom opposed this intervention, based on its own experiences in Northern
Ireland. WEU's first peacekeeping action came in 1992 in Yugoslavia, in cooperation with
NATO. The fate of WEU depends largely on future development of the European Community.
Goodby sees WEU's most promising role as cooperating with NATO, and helping the EC to
stabilize the economies of East Central Europe and the former Soviet states.</p>

<p>Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)</p>

<p>In 1992 the former Soviet states of Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan created the CIS, specifically to serve as an organ of
collective security. While promising, the CIS has had some initial difficulties in
establishing a truly multilateral structure. CIS peacekeeping forces are composed
predominately of Russian troops. This tends to undermine the impartiality needed for
peacekeeping actions. Russia has been slow to withdraw its troops from neighboring states,
and protests from those states have prompted the OCSE to send observer missions. The
situation is further aggravated by Russian politicians with imperial ambitions, and by
Moscow's assumed role as protector of ethnic Russians in the other nations of the former
Soviet Union.</p>
