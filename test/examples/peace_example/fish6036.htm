<p>Fisher, Roger, Elizabeth Kopelman and Andrea Kupfer Schneider. &quot;Look Behind
Statements for Underlying Interests.&quot; <u>Beyond Machiavelli: Tools for Coping with
Conflict</u>. Cambridge, London: Harvard University Press, 1994. Pp. 39-40.</em></p>

<p>Looking beyond positions to the interests underlying them is a technique of finding
common ground between the opponents, since there are usually some shared interests
present. Some of those interests can even be satisfied without causing any damage to the
party's position. To help in understanding shared interests, it might be useful to write
down in columns the positions, and long-term as well as short term interests of the
parties.</p>

<p>An example is given by a table (p. 40) of positions and interests of Sikhs and Hindus,
whose conflict has been escalating for quite a long time. The table shows that the
positions of the opponents are in opposition: Sikhs want independence and more access to
water resources while Hindus believe that India should be unified and water resources
should be distributed equally. Despite a lot of differences in their interests, the
following similarities can be found: both wish economic prosperity for Punjab, and
reduction of Sikh terrorist activities and ethnic fighting. The most obvious similarity is
in their &quot;domestic political interests.&quot; Both communities want the Sikhs to
&quot;regain confidence in the Indian government&quot; (p. 40). </p>

<p>Awareness of the interests of the other party helps to understand its concerns and
challenges our views toward inclusivity and recognition, thus de-escalating the
disagreement. </p>
