<p>Susan L. Carpenter and W.J.D. Kennedy, &quot;Working With the Media&quot; in Managing
Public Disputes, (San Francisco: Jossey- Bass, 1988) pp. 182-186.</em></p>

<p>Carpenter and Kennedy discuss the importance of working effectively with the media to
successfully manage public disputes. Often participants and conflict managers would prefer
closed meetings. Attempting to exclude the media often antagonizes them, and may infringe
on the public's right to know. Reasons to hold closed meetings include the presence of
proprietary information, of a party who has been misrepresented by the press before, and
so refuses to participate in open negotiations, or by particularly poor relations between
the parties which makes conciliation under the public eye very unlikely. Meetings should
only be closed by the consensus decision of the participants, so that there are no
dissenting parties who can use the decision as leverage against the other parties. Closed
meetings should be followed promptly by a press conference and press releases.</p>

<p>Public officials may be wary of the press, but outright hostility will provoke
antagonism. Instead, officials should seek out interested reporters and attempt to provide
clear, detailed and thorough information regarding the project at hand. The clearer the
presentation, the more likely it is to be accurately reported. Members of the press can
also be valuable resources for conflict managers. Reporters are often very informed about
their community. Giving thorough information and seeking the reporter's advice helps
create mutual respect.</p>

<p>Finally, officials should develop an explicit strategy for dealing with the media
regarding the project at hand. The authors recommend a cooperative approach, which treats
media members like interested members of the community. When approached in such a spirit,
the press can actually become a valuable source of support.</p>
