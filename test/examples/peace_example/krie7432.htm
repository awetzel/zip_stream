<p><em>Louis Kriesberg, &quot;Factors prompting De-escalation in the Middle East&quot;
International Conflict Resolution, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992) 65-68.</em></p>

<p>Kriesberg argues that de-escalation initiatives are influenced by domestic
circumstances, by the international context and by the relations between the protagonists.
He examines all of these factors in relation to the Israeli-Arab conflict.</p>

<h4>Arab-Israeli relations:</h4>

<p>Early Arab-Israeli relations were polarized. Arab nationalism opposed the formation of
a Jewish state. Arab opposition contributed to Jewish militancy. The actual creation of
Israel intensified the identity of non-Jews as Palestinians. The Islamic revival increased
religious opposition to a Jewish state. Adopting Marxist and socialist perspectives, the
Arab nations saw Israel as a creature of Western imperialism. This period was marked by
wars.</p>

<p>In 1967 Israeli army seized new territories. In 1973 the Egyptian and Syrian attack on
Israel ended in stalemate. Egyptian honor was somewhat restored by their limited military
success, and Egyptian-Israeli relations improved after the stalemate. Relations with the
other Arab states, however, remained hostile.</p>

<h4>Egypt:</h4>

<p>Egyptian President Sadat acknowledges that his 1971 peace initiative was in response to
public pressure. &quot;I believed that as military action was ruled out at the time, a
diplomatic offensive had to be launched: the broad masses wanted to see action being taken
at the time.&quot;[p.65] The 1977 bread riots in Egypt also demanded action. As neither
the Soviets nor the other Arab nations were reliable sources of support, Egypt had begun
to cultivate American favor. Peace with Israel was necessary to gain the further goodwill
and support of the U.S. Pressure from the masses of Palestinians living in Jordan
prevented King Hussein from offering substantial accommodations to Israel. Yasir Arafat's
leadership of the Palestinian people was contested by other, more extreme, Palestinian
groups. Such competition for leadership inhibited Arafat's ability to negotiate. &quot;As
the moderate, he seemed reluctant to take any de-escalation initiative for fear of being
outflanked by groups more extreme in their demands against Israel.&quot;[p. 67] </p>

<h4>Israel:</h4>

<p>Israeli public opinion has long desired peace, but believed that the Arab states were
uninterested in peace. Differences in opinion among various Israeli political parties were
mooted by the perceived lack of any negotiating partner. When Sadat signaled Egyptian
willingness to negotiate, domestic differences of opinion began to take on more
significance. </p>

<p>Since then, Israeli peace initiatives have been inhibited by the domestic competition
between the various political parties for strong public support. Public backlash to the
violence under the Likud party government removed them from power in the early 1980s.
However, public perception that a party is too accommodating of Arab demands equally
threatens to undermine that party's support, and increase support for the domestic
opposition party. Thus the Likud party regained power after Rabin's assassination.</p>

<h3>The International Context</h3>

<p>Starting in the 1950s, the Cold War became the dominant context for the Arab Israeli
conflict. The influx of arms and support to their respective allies from the Cold War
superpowers encouraged a general escalation of conflicts in the Middle East. </p>

<p>Regional rivalries were also a significant context for the Arab-Israeli conflict. Arab
nations competed for influence in the Arab world, and influence over the Palestinians.
Resolutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which appeared to favor an Arab nation
would be opposed by other Arab states.</p>

<p>Kriesberg argues that the superimposition of global and regional conflicts onto the
Arab- Israeli conflict served to inhibit de-escalation efforts. The immediate issues in
the Arab-Israeli conflict became linked to broader issues. However, when these broader
conflicts began to de-escalate, it correspondingly opened up the possibility of
de-escalation in the Arab-Israeli conflict. </p>
