<p>How humans explain what is happening as they interact is important for understanding
social conflict. Berger and Luckman ( 1966 ) see conflict as created socially by the
conflict parties out of their everyday activity. This process of social creation happens
as we first externalize what we believe is happening. For example, when we make a new
friend (or enemy), we create a relationship. We recreate it each time we interact with
that friend (or enemy). (For example, two physicists often have need for the same lab
space, equipment and graduate student at the same time. On one such occasion, they have a
nasty encounter in which personal insults occur. From that time forward, the joint problem
of scarce resources is redefined by each as a conflict.) The new product (friendship or
conflictive relationship) is then objectified as it fits into the descriptive terminology
and other parts of the objective order society already has in place to describe such
interaction. We then internalize that new &quot;objective reality,&quot; feeling that it
fits our experience and we act accordingly. It thus becomes &quot;reality&quot; for us
even though our perception may have little basis in fact. Each conflict becomes a clash of
contending realties, with opponents convinced it is factually based.&nbsp; Getting
conflict parties to question the objective reality of their conflict permits them to
identify aspects of it truly in opposition from those that are not. Once they realize they
are not in total conflict, they can begin to cooperate in turning the conflicting
interests into a problem to be solved. If a conflict is a &quot;reality&quot; constructed
by opponents, it can just as well be reconstructed by them into less costly or more
cooperative forms. They reconceptualize reality as something they produce and can thus
reconstruct toward cooperative relations.&nbsp; Enemy images are the most harmful and
resistant form of constructed conflict reality. One believes and expects the worst of an
enemy. Getting opponents to reconstruct their &quot;enemy reality&quot; has been the focus
of several &quot;enemy reality&quot; reconstruction projects.&nbsp; </p>
