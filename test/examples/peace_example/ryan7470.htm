<p><em>Stephen Ryan, &quot;Peace-Building and Conflict Transformation,&quot; chapt. in
Ethnic Conflict and International Relations, (Dartmouth: Dartmouth Publishing, 1995), pp.
129-152.</em></p>

<p>Ryan discusses peace-building strategies. Peace-building strategies focus on the
attitudes and socioeconomic status of ordinary persons. They seek greater inter-group
contact, and tend to focus on the relationships more than the issues. </p>

<p>Contact</p>

<p>The contact hypothesis is the &quot;belief that interaction between individuals
belonging to different groups will reduce ethnic prejudice and inter-group
tension&quot;[p. 131]. Interaction can come through trade, business, trade unions,
professional meetings, sports and the like. Ryan argues that the idea that greater contact
alone will build peace is flawed. Research shows that contact only improves attitudes when
that contact is intimate, pleasant, between equals, socially supported, and in pursuit of
common goals. Absent those conditions, increased contact may lead to increased hostility.
Many theorists question whether intergroup conflicts can be resolved by interpersonal
contact. When contact does lead to improved personal attitudes, the changed individuals
face a re-entry problem as they return to their communities. Their new more positive
attitudes toward the opponent are likely to be greeted with suspicion by their own
community. Ryan argues that contact alone is not sufficient to build peace. He examines
several strategies which combine contact with other elements.</p>

<p>Contact with Forgiveness</p>

<p>Forgiveness has been an important element of religious peace traditions. These
traditions emphasize reconciliation. Martin Luther King and Gandhi both exemplify this
tradition. This approach tends to emphasize adversaries' common humanity, common suffering
as a basis for understanding and redemption, shared responsibility for the acts of the
adversary, and the obligation to love the enemy. </p>

<p>Ryan observes that thus approach can have great impacts on individuals. However, he
raises two criticisms. First, the forgiveness approach focuses on cultural factors, and
neglects structural factors. Again, there is some doubt that personal transformations can
address group conflicts. Second, the approach may not be pragmatic enough for wide-scale
use, as it is based on a degree of religious faith that many do not share.</p>

<p>Contact with Superordinate Goals</p>

<p>A superordinate goal is &quot; an urgent goal that could only be achieved by
cooperation between the conflicting groups.&quot;[p. 137] Experimental research has found
that pursuit of such goals can help reduce stereotyping and hostility between adversarial
groups. Drawing on this research, some theorists have suggested the creation of
supra-national institutions to pursue key economic and social goals. Their hope is that
the interdependence will broaden narrowly defined identities and reduce conflict. Ryan
cautions that when the costs and benefits of interdependence are not equally shared,
interdependence may become a source of conflict. The creation of European supranational
bodies has had mixed effects. </p>

<p>This approach has had some success on local levels. In Sri Lanka multiethnic teams have
been formed to dig wells and rebuild houses. In Northern Ireland the mid-Ulster Basketball
Club brings together children and parents from both Protestant and Catholic communities. </p>

<p>Contact with Economic Development</p>

<p>Violent conflict usually results in underdevelopment. It is often hoped that economic
development can reduce ethnic violence. However, Ryan is critical of this idea. Ryan notes
that there is little evidence that development promotes peace. He points out that this
theory tends to &quot;overstate the power of economic development to change identity and
underestimate the attachment to ethnic identity, whatever the economic situation.&quot;[p.
141] For example, standards of living were rising when violence erupted in Northern
Ireland. Inequalities in the distribution of new wealth may simply reinforce existing
divisions, or may themselves spark new conflict. Still, economic development which is
sensitive to cultural differences and which aims at fulfilling local needs and increasing
local participation could be a valuable element in the peace- building process. </p>

<p>The Malaysian case shows the complex relations between economic development and peace.
Through the 1960s, Malaysia's increasing wealth tended to go to the non-Malay communities.
Ethnic tensions increased, and rioting broke out in 1969. The government instituted
policies designed to distribute economic benefits more evenly. Ethnic violence was largely
ended. However Indian and Chinese communities resented the perceived favoritism shown
Malays. Growing wealth disparities within the Malay community have been ignored in pursuit
of intergroup parity. Poor Malays have demanded more positive discrimination in their
favor, and that has increased concerns in the non-Malay communities. Finally the move
toward a state-enforced economic distribution has undermined consocial politics and the
quality of democracy in Malaysia.</p>

<p>Contact with Confidence Building</p>

<p>Effective communication and negotiations require some degree of trust between the
parties. Confidence building measures aim to create that trust. One important confidence
building strategy is the Gradual Reduction in Tensions (GRIT) approach. GRIT begins with
one side making a verifiable, unilateral concession, and signaling its expectation that
the other side will respond in kind. The concession should involve some cost, but should
not affect safety and security interests. If the other side responds in kind, a series of
unilateral initiatives may ensue. If not, nothing substantial has been lost. Third-parties
can help the process along by verifying concessions or maintaining neutral zones.
Confidence building measures can be undermined by the well-established psychological
tendency toward &quot;hypothesis conformation.&quot; People tend to interpret others'
actions in ways that reinforce their existing attitudes toward those others. And so
conciliatory gesture are likely to be misinterpreted, or to be attributed to circumstances
beyond the other's control.</p>

<p>Contact with Education</p>

<p>Education for mutual understanding (EMU) or multi-cultural education focuses on
children and young adults, and seeks to produce generational changes in attitude. Such
educational programs emphasize reason, imagination, critical thinking, openness and love
of truth. They introduce students to the languages, cultures, histories and religions of
other societies in addition to their own. The EMU movement has been influential in
Northern Ireland. Ryan cautions that schools are only one source of influence for
children. Formal education alone is unlikely to overcome negative images perpetuated by
the family, community, church and media.</p>

<p>Prejudice reduction in adults is also an important part of peace-building. Programs to
reduce prejudices include formal education, community conferences or festivals, mass media
campaigns, encouragement from respected leaders, and individual therapy. Attempts to
address prejudice encounter the same &quot;hypothesis conformation&quot; problem noted
above. Prejudices against others may also play a significant role in maintaining an
individual's own positive self- image.</p>

<p>Just as personal attitudes must be examined, so must cultural attitudes. National
identities can be exclusionary. Intellectuals and artists can play an important role in
peace- building by examining cultural traditions and myths, by deconstructing exclusionist
myths, and by reconstructing a more pluralist, inclusive set of cultural myths and
traditions. The Field Day project in Northern Ireland is an example of such cultural
exploration. Field Day is an association of poets, actors and playwrights who seek to
shift understanding of Irish culture away from the romantic Celtic approach of Yeats by
drawing on the more pluralistic approaches of Joyce and Beckett. The group is also
producing an anthology of Irish literature which highlights the various traditions which
have contributed to Irish literature.</p>
